    <p>Collections in Python — Edureka</p>
    <p>
      Python programming language has four collection data types- list, tuple,
      sets, and dictionary. But python also comes with a built-in module known
      as collections which have specialized data structures which basically
      covers for the shortcomings of the four data types. In this article, we
      will go through each of those specialized data structures in detail.
      Following are the subjects shrouded in this article:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What Are Collections In Python?</li>
      <li>Specialized Collection Data Structures</li>
    </ul>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>namedtuple( )</li>
      <li>deque</li>
      <li>ChainMap</li>
      <li>Counter</li>
      <li>OrderedDict</li>
      <li>defaultdict</li>
      <li>UserDict</li>
      <li>UserList</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Collections in python are basically container data types, namely lists,
      sets, tuples, dictionary. They have different characteristics based on the
      declaration and usage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A list is declared in square brackets, it is mutable, stores duplicate
        values and elements can be accessed using indexes.
      </li>
      <li>
        A tuple is ordered and immutable in nature, although duplicate entries
        can be there inside a tuple.
      </li>
      <li>
        A set is unordered and declared in square brackets. It is not indexed
        and does not have duplicate entries as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        A dictionary has key-value pairs and is mutable in nature. We use square
        brackets to declare a dictionary.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are the python’s general-purpose built-in container data types. But
      as we all know, python always has a little something extra to offer. It
      comes with a python module named collections which has specialized data
      structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collections module in python implements specialized data structures which
      provide an alternative to python’s built-in container data types.
      Following are the specialized data structures in the collections module.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>namedtuple( )</li>
      <li>deque</li>
      <li>Chainmap</li>
      <li>Counter</li>
      <li>OrderedDict</li>
      <li>defaultdict</li>
      <li>UserDict</li>
      <li>UserList</li>
      <li>UserString</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="namedtuple">namedtuple( )</h2>
    <p>
      It returns a tuple with a named entry, which means there will be a name
      assigned to each value in the tuple. It overcomes the problem of accessing
      the elements using the index values. With namedtuple( ) it becomes easier
      to access these values since you do not have to remember the index values
      to get specific elements.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How It Works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      First of all, you must import the collections module, it does not require
      installation.
    </p>
    <p>from collections import namedtuple</p>
    <p>Look at the following code to understand how you can use namedtuple.</p>
    <p>
      a = namedtuple(‘courses’ , ‘name , tech’)<br />
      s = a(‘data science’ , ‘python’)<br />
      print(s)
    </p>
    <p>#the output will be courses(name=‘python’ , tech=‘python’)</p>
    <p><strong>How To Create A namedtuple Using A List?</strong></p>
    <p>
      s._make([‘data science’ , ‘python’])<br />
      #the output will be same as before.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deque">deque</h2>
    <p>
      deque pronounced as ‘deck’ is an optimized list to perform insertion and
      deletion easily.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      #creating a deque<br />
      from collections import deque
    </p>
    <p>
      a = [‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’]<br />
      a1 = deque(a)<br />
      print(a1)<br />
      #the output will be deque([ ‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’ ])
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let’s take a look at how we will insert and remove items from deque.
    </p>
    <p>
      a1.append(‘a’)<br />
      print(a1)<br />
      # the output will be deque([ ‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’ , ‘a’ ])<br />
      a1.appendleft(‘e’)<br />
      print(a1)<br />
      # the output will be deque([‘e’ , ‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’ , ‘a’ ])
    </p>
    <p>
      As should be obvious, inserting a component is enhanced utilizing deque,
      also you can remove components as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      a1.pop()<br />
      print(a1)<br />
      #the output will be deque([ ‘e’ , ‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’ ])<br />
      a1.popleft()<br />
      print(a1)<br />
      #the output will be deque([ ‘d’ , ‘u’ , ‘r’ , ‘e’ , ‘k’ ])
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to the built-in data types, there are several other operations
      that we can perform on a deque. Like counting elements or clearing the
      deque etc.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chainmap">ChainMap</h2>
    <p>
      It is a dictionary-like class which is able to make a single view of
      multiple mappings. It basically returns a list of several other
      dictionaries. Suppose you have two dictionaries with several key-value
      pairs, in this case, ChainMap will make a single list with both the
      dictionaries in it.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      from collections import ChainMap<br />
      a = { 1: ‘edureka’ , 2: ‘python’}<br />
      b = {3: ‘data science’ , 4: ‘Machine learning’}<br />
      c = ChainMap(a,b)<br />
      print(c)<br />
      #the output will be ChainMap[{1: ‘edureka’ , 2: ‘python’} , {3: ‘data
      science’ , 4: ‘Machine learning’}]
    </p>
    <p>
      To access or insert elements we use the keys as an index. But to add a new
      dictionary in the ChainMap we use the following approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      a1 = { 5: ‘AI’ , 6: ‘neural networks’}<br />
      c1 = c.new_child(a1)<br />
      print(c1)<br />
      #the output will be ChainMap[{1: ‘edureka’ , 2: ‘python’} , {3: ‘data
      science’ , 4: ‘Machine learning’}, { 5: ‘AI’ , 6: ‘neural networks’}]
    </p>
    <h2 id="counter">Counter</h2>
    <p>It is a dictionary subclass which is used to count hashable objects.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      from collections import Counter<br />
      a = [1,1,1,1,2,3,3,4,3,3,4]<br />
      c = Counter(a)<br />
      print(c)<br />
      #the output will be Counter = ({1:4 , 2:1 , 3:4 , 4:2})
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the operations, you can perform on a dictionary Counter has
      3 more operations that we can perform.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        element function — It returns a list containing all the elements in the
        Counter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most_common( ) — It returns a sorted list with the count of each element
        in the Counter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Subtract( ) — It takes an iterable object as an argument and deducts the
        count of the elements in the Counter.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="ordereddict">OrderedDict</h2>
    <p>
      It is a dictionary subclass which remembers the order in which the entries
      were added. Basically, even if you change the value of the key, the
      position will not be changed because of the order in which it was inserted
      in the dictionary.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      from collections import OrderedDict<br />
      od = OrderedDict()<br />
      od[1] = ‘e’<br />
      od[2] = ‘d’<br />
      od[3] = ‘u’<br />
      od[4] = ‘r’<br />
      od[5] = ‘e’<br />
      od[6] = ‘k’<br />
      od[7] = ‘a’<br />
      print(od)<br />
      #the output will be OrderedDict[(1 , ‘e’), (2 , ‘d’) , (3 , ‘u’), (4 ,
      ‘r’), (5 , ‘e’), (6 , ‘k’), (7 , ‘a’)]
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not matter what value gets inserted in the dictionary, the
      OrderedDict remembers the order in which it was inserted and gets the
      output accordingly. Even if we change the value of the key. Let’s say, if
      we change the key-value 4 to 8, the order will not change in the output.
    </p>
    <h2 id="defaultdict">defaultdict</h2>
    <p>
      It is a dictionary subclass which calls a factory function to supply
      missing values. In general, it does not throw any errors when a missing
      key value is called in a dictionary.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
    <p>
      from collections import defaultdict<br />
      d = defaultdict(int)<br />
      #we have to specify a type as well.<br />
      d[1] = ‘edureka’<br />
      d[2] = ‘python’<br />
      print(d[3])<br />
      #it will give the output as 0 instead of keyerror.
    </p>
    <h2 id="userdict">UserDict</h2>
    <p>
      This class acts as a wrapper around dictionary objects. The need for this
      class came from the necessity to subclass directly from dict. It becomes
      easier to work with this class as the underlying dictionary becomes an
      attribute.
    </p>
    <p>class collections.UserDict([initialdata])</p>
    <p>
      This class simulates a dictionary. The content of the instance are kept in
      a regular dictionary which can be accessed with the ‘data’ attribute of
      the class UserDict. The reference of initial data is not kept, for it to
      be used for other purposes.
    </p>
    <h2 id="userlist">UserList</h2>
    <p>
      This class acts like a wrapper around the list-objects. It is a useful
      base class for other lists like classes which can inherit from them and
      override the existing methods or even add fewer new ones as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for this class came from the necessity to subclass directly from
      the list. It becomes easier to work with this class as the underlying list
      becomes an attribute.
    </p>
    <p>class collections.UserList([list])</p>
    <p>
      It is the class that simulates a list. The contents of the instance are
      kept in a customary list. The sub-classes of the list are relied upon to
      offer a constructor which can be called with either no or one contention.
