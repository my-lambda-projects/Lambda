      A python developer is responsible for writing server-side application
      logic. There is an alarming rate of jobs created every day for a python
      developer. Companies are switching to a python programming language which
      has created an opportunity for python programmers and developers. Let us
      take a look at a typical job description that a company provides for a job
      as a python developer.
    </p>
    <p>A typical job description looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We are looking for a python developer responsible for managing the
        interchange of data between the servers and the user. Your primary focus
        will be the development of all server-side logic, ensuring high
        performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end. You will
        also be responsible for integrating the front-end elements built by your
        co-workers into the application. Therefore, a basic understanding of
        front-end technologies is a must as well.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To get a broader narrative,
      <strong>here is another job description</strong> for a python developer.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We are looking for a python developer to join our engineering team and
        help us develop and maintain various software products. The
        responsibilities include writing and testing code, debugging programs
        and integrating applications with third-party web servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be successful in this role, you should have experience using
        server-side logic and work well in a team. Ultimately, you will build
        highly responsive web applications that align with our business needs.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is how a typical job description for a python developer looks like,
      but it may vary according to different companies and what they seek from a
      python developer resume.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Functional —</strong> Mention your experience based on the
        relevant job role.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chronological —</strong> Mention your experience in the same way
        it took place.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your approach should fulfill the following points when you are building a
      python developer resume:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concise and clear in terms of formatting</li>
      <li>Updated resume</li>
      <li>

      <li>Achievements and hobbies must be included</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Let us consider the various job trends present for a junior and a senior
      python developer in 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      As we can see in the graphs shown above, for a junior python developer,
      the number of permanent jobs has taken a great leap during the last 5
      years. With more than 20% increase in the jobs, it is only going to grow
      from here considering the latest innovations and advancements in the IT
      industry where companies are starting to move to a python programming
      language with an exponential rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the senior python developer jobs, it is significantly higher than
      ever, with experience in the field of python programming gives you an edge
      over other candidates which improves your chances of getting that job.
    </p>
    <p>Let us consider the salary trends of python developer in 2019.</p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at these statistics it is evident enough that a python developer
      on an average makes around $92k a year, and it can go up to $137k a year
      in some cases.
    </p>
