# Objective 01 - Understand logarithms and recall the common cases where they come up in technical interviews

## **Overview**

### **What is a logarithm?**

Logarithms are a way of looking differently at exponentials. I know that this is a bit of a vague definition, so let's look at an example.

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5)

What does the mathematical expression above *mean*? It's an abbreviation for the following expression:

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%20*%202%20*%202%20*%202%20*%202](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%20*%202%20*%202%20*%202%20*%202)

What we are looking at above is two different ways to express an object that doubles in size with each iteration.

Another way to think about `2^5 = 32` is that `2` is the "growth rate" and `5` is the number of times you went through the growth (doubling). `32` is the final result.

Let's look at a few more expressions:

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5%20%3D%2032](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5%20%3D%2032)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E0%20%3D%201](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E0%20%3D%201)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E%7B-1%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E%7B-1%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D)

Now, to begin looking at logarithms, let's rewrite the exponential expressions above in logarithmic form.

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%2032%20%3D%205](https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%2032%20%3D%205)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%201%20%3D%200](https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%201%20%3D%200)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%3D%201](https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%3D%201)

Notice how we have essentially just moved around different pieces of the expression.

For our first expression,

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5%20%3D%2032](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5E5%20%3D%2032)

`2` was the "growth rate", `5` was the "time" spent growing, and `32` was where we ended up. When we rewrite this logarithmically, we have

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%2032%20%3D%205](https://i.upmath.me/svg/log_2%2032%20%3D%205)

In this case, `2` still represents the "growth rate" and `32` still represents where we end up. The `5` also still represents the "time" spent growing.

So, the difference between when we would use a logarithm and when we use exponentiation depends on what factors we know ahead of time. If you know the growth rate and you know how long you are growing, you can use exponentiation (`2^5`) to figure out where you end up (`32`). However, if you know the growth rate and where you end up but do not know the time spent growing, you can use a logarithm (`log_2 32`) to figure that out.

Logarithms have an *inverse* relationship with exponents, just like division and multiplication have an inverse relationship.

For example, if you know that you have one group of `5` items and you want to identify the total you would have if you had `4` of those groups instead of just one, you could express that with `5 * 4 = 20`. However, if you knew that you had a total of `20` items and you wanted to know how many groups of `5` you could make out your total, you could express that with `20 \ 5 = 4`.

## **Follow Along**

### **Why should I care? What does this have to do with programming and interview preparation?**

In computer science, you often ask questions like *"How many times must `n` be divided in half before we get to one?"* or *"How many times will we halve this collection before the collection has only one item?"* To answer these questions, **you can use logarithms!** Halving is like doubling, so we can say that `log_2 n` would give us the answer we're seeking.

You will see this come up when analyzing the time complexity of specific algorithms. Any algorithm that doubles or halves a number or collection on each iteration of a loop is likely to have `O(log n)` time complexity. You will see this come up specifically when we talk about binary search and its time complexity. You will also see this come up in specific sorting algorithms (like merge sort). In simple terms, merge sort divides a collection in half and then merges the sorted halves. The fact that the algorithm repeatedly *halves* something is your clue that it includes a logarithm in its time complexity. One last place you're likely to see logarithms come up is with a perfect binary tree. One property of these binary trees is that the number of nodes *doubles* at each level.

## **Challenge**

1. Write a logarithmic expression that is identical to this exponential expression:

   [https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5En%20%3D%2064](https://i.upmath.me/svg/2%5En%20%3D%2064)

2. Write an exponential expression that is identical to this logarithmic expression:

3. What keywords should you look out for that might alert you that logarithms are involved?

# Objective 02 - Write a linear search algorithm

## **Overview**

Imagine that I've chosen a random number from 1 to 20. Then, you must guess the number. One approach would be to start picking at 1 and increment your guess by 1 with each guess. If the computer randomly selected 20, then it would take you 20 guesses to get the correct answer. If the computer guessed 1, then you would have the right answer on your very first guess. On average, you will get the correct answer on the 10th or 11th guess.

If the collection we are searching through is random and unsorted, linear search is the most efficient way to search through it. Once we have a sorted list, then there are more efficient approaches to use.

## **Follow Along**

We want to write a simple program to conduct a linear search on a collection of data. Let's write a function that takes a list (`arr`) and an integer (`target`) as its input and returns the integer `idx` where the target is found. If the `target` does not exist in the `arr`, then the function should return `-1`.

```
def linear_search(arr, target):
    # loop through each item in the input array
    for idx in range(len(arr)):
        # check if the item at the current index is equal to the target
        if arr[idx] == target:
            # return the current index as the match
            return idx
    # if we were able to loop through the entire array, the target is not present
    return -1
```

# Objective 03 - Identify when a problem is amenable to a recursive solution and use recursion to solve it

## **Overview**

### **What is recursion?**

Recursion is a method to solve problems. It means breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller sub-problems until the sub-problem is easy to solve. Recursive functions call themselves. Often, recursive solutions are terse and elegant. Recursive solutions are not always the most efficient. However, they can be an excellent starting point that you can improve the efficiency of later on.

### **A simple example**

Let's say that I give you a list of numbers.

```
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

I ask you to write a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

With an iterative approach, you would need a variable to keep track of the sum, a loop that adds each item in the list to the sum, and to return the sum after the loop ends.

```
def sum_list(items):
    sum = 0
    for i in items:
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
```

This iterative function depends on the ability to loop through each item in the list. Another way to iterate through a collection is with recursion. It's a little harder to understand at first, but the resulting code is often cleaner, simpler, and easier to understand.

How many numbers can you sum without having to rely on the loop construct? The answer is two. How can we think of our problem as a collection of sums of only two numbers?

I'll put it another way. If you had the following, and I asked you to use parentheses to split the problem into sums of two numbers, how would you do it?

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Here is one way you could do it:

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c3712760c00261a99af75bba229c5c054ae2880/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f61633061313039382d323265372d343533392d613239312d3065356130646262356333635f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d3031312e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6c3712760c00261a99af75bba229c5c054ae2880/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f61633061313039382d323265372d343533392d613239312d3065356130646262356333635f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d3031312e676966)

You start by separating the problem into two subproblems:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
(1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5))
```

Now we continue doing so until we can no longer divide the problem into two subproblems:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
(1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5))
(1 + (2 + (3 + 4 + 5)))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5))))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5)))))
```

Let's see if we can use this example to write a recursive function to sum a list of numbers.

The first thing we need to consider for our recursive function is how to know when to stop adding parentheses.

When we add the first set, we ask — what is the sum of the first item and the sum of the rest of the items?

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e97c657ba934647c228b3c0f736cf5bf82a3c6f/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f65306131323864612d373533662d346563372d626437312d6339336331653165333431365f53322d4d322d4f314669727374616e64526573742e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5e97c657ba934647c228b3c0f736cf5bf82a3c6f/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f65306131323864612d373533662d346563372d626437312d6339336331653165333431365f53322d4d322d4f314669727374616e64526573742e676966)

But, as we continue dividing the problem into subproblems, we "run out" of the "rest of items." Once we no longer have a list of items longer than one, we cannot break the list into the first item and the rest of the items. So if someone asks us to sum one number, we know that the result is equal to that number. This "running out" is the base case for our recursive function.

_Note: We usually place the base case of a recursive function in the first few lines of the function, though it doesn't have to be there._

Let's start writing out our function in pseudocode:

```
sum_list(items)
    if the length of items is one
        return the one item in the list
```

But what if someone asks us to sum more than one item? We must sum the first number and the sum of the rest of the items in the list.

Let's add this to our pseudocode:

```
sum_list(items)
    if the length of items is one
        return the one item in the list
    otherwise
        return the first item from the list + sum_list(the rest of the items)
```

Now let's convert our pseudocode into actual Python code:

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1:
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:])
```

Now that we have our function defined let's see what happens when we call it.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c04e4d5adb8ef8c75edbfc384de1ba3612472543/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f36663538366565382d333433662d346336322d613934652d6662646137373261623265395f53322d4d322d4f312d53756d2d4c6973742d43616c6c2d537461636b2d416e696d6174696f6e2e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c04e4d5adb8ef8c75edbfc384de1ba3612472543/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f36663538366565382d333433662d346336322d613934652d6662646137373261623265395f53322d4d322d4f312d53756d2d4c6973742d43616c6c2d537461636b2d416e696d6174696f6e2e676966)

You can see how the recursive calls go "out" before returning and starting working their way "back" to the original call.

### **An even simpler example**

Maybe you're still confused. Let's write a recursive function that can print each integer from `n` down to `0`.

We start by writing our function in pseudocode.

```
print_to_zero(n):
    print n
    if n is 0
        return
    return print_to_zero(n - 1)
```

The first line of our pseudocode function prints the value of `n`. Then, we check the base case — is `n` equal to `0` — and, if it is, we return and stop recursing. Our pseudocode's final return is our recursive case, where we decrement the previous call's `n` value and call the function itself with that decremented value (the recursive case).

Let's turn it into actual Python code and then look at a visualization of the call stack when we call this function.

```
def print_to_zero(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0: # base case
        return
    return print_to_zero(n - 1) # recursive case
```

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0c1be0c05ece4b456a0cc37a2024ad6ae1544d76/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f66366432346533362d643839312d343132372d626230362d6561323263623232343765635f53322d4d322d4f315072696e74746f5a65726f56697375616c697a6174696f6e2e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0c1be0c05ece4b456a0cc37a2024ad6ae1544d76/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f66366432346533362d643839312d343132372d626230362d6561323263623232343765635f53322d4d322d4f315072696e74746f5a65726f56697375616c697a6174696f6e2e676966)

One thing you might've realized is that our current function doesn't handle inputs of less than `0`. Ideally, our function should take these inputs without getting stuck in an infinite recursion (which would lead to a stack overflow).

Let's modify our function so that it handles inputs of less than zero.

```
def print_to_zero(n):
    if n < 0: # base case
        return
    print(n)
    return print_to_zero(n - 1) # recursive case
```

### **Three rules of recursion**

Let's use our `sum_list` function to see if we can make more generalized observations about recursion.

The three rules for a recursive function are:

1. Must have a base case
2. Must change its state to move towards the base case
3. Must call itself

### **1. Must have a base case**

The first rule for recursion is that a recursive algorithm **_must have a base case_**.

What is a base case? It allows the algorithm to *stop* recursing. With our `sum_list` function, what allows the algorithm to stop recursing?

It's the first line: `if len(items) == 1:`. Notice how if this condition is true, it returns a value and doesn't make a recursive call to itself. We are saying to stop recursing if the list to sum has only one item.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:])
```

### **2. Must change its state to move towards the base case**

The second rule is that the algorithm **_must change its state to move towards the base case_**.

How does our function do that? With each subsequent recursion, the list passed into `sum_list` is one item smaller. For example, on the first recursion, `items` is `[2,3,4,5]`, and on the subsequent recursion, `items` is `[3,4,5]`.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:]) # items[1:] has one less item
```

It's obvious then that regardless of the list's length, we will reach the base case where the list we are summing has only one item.

### **3. Must call itself**

The third rule is that the algorithm **_must call itself_**. We are doing this on the final line of the function.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:]) # Calls sum_list recursively
```

### **When should I use recursion?**

Now that we've considered one recursive algorithm and discussed the three recursion rules, we should think about when it is appropriate to use recursion.

When you are out in the world solving real-world problems, the problem itself doesn't say, "Hey! You should use recursion to solve me!" It's your job as the problem-solver to decide if using recursion makes sense.

So, what clues or hints might you find within a problem that could lead you to use recursion?

- Compute the nth term
- List the first or last n terms
- Generate all permutations

Another way to think about it is to use the three rules. Is there a clear base case or stopping point that you are working towards (Rule 1)? Is there a straightforward way that the state of the data changes with each iteration that brings it closer to the base case (Rule 2)?

## **Follow Along**

Let's look at another typical example of learning recursion–computing factorials.

A factorial (`n!`) is computed by taking `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... 1`.

For example, `4!` is computed by doing the following:

`4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

`4 * 3 * 2 * 1`

`24`

When does computing factorials come in handy? They are required when figuring combinations; how many ways can we arrange these many items? Or how many orders can there be with this list? Also, they are useful for determining ways of choosing a certain number of items from a collection. For example, if you have 100 different menu items, how many possible 5-item orders could you make?

Okay, let's get back to our `4!` example. Let's look again at the computation and see if we can make some connections to our three rules for recursion.

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

First, how did we know to stop writing? Why didn't we keep going?

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3) * (4 - 4) * (4 - 5) * (4 - 6) * ...`

Well, before, when talking about the general case, we wrote factorial like this:

`n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... 1`

What is the last item in the procedure, or how did we know to stop? When the item is `1`. Could this serve as the base case for our recursive factorial function? Let's try it out!

We start by writing pseudocode.

```
recursive_factorial(n)
    if n equals 1
        return 1
```

Okay, so now we have a base case (Rule 1). But what about changing the state to move towards the base case (Rule 2)?

Let's look again at `4!`.

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

Notice that just like we can write `4!` as `4 * (4 - 1) * ... 1`, we can write `(4 - 1)!` as `(4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * ... 1`. So the inverse would also be true; we can write `(4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * ... 1` as `(4 - 1)!`. Which means we can write `4!` as `4 * (4 - 1)!`.

Okay, we can't miss what we just discovered. Our discovery means that we can express factorial in terms of itself. For any `n!` we can solve it by breaking it into smaller sub-problems that also require factorial (Rule 3). And Rule 2 is satisfied because we make each subsequent call to factorial on a smaller `n`.

```
recursive_factorial(n)
    if n equals 1
        return 1
    otherwise
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)
```

Now we need to convert our pseudocode into actual Python code. Luckily, in Python, this is usually a trivial change.

```
def recursive_factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)
```

## **Challenge**

1. Write a *recursive* search function that receives as input an array of integers and a target integer value. This function should return `True` if the target element exists in the array, and `False` otherwise.
   - What would be the base case(s) we'd have to consider for implementing this function?
   - How should our recursive solution converge on our base case(s)?
2. In your own words, write out the three rules for recursion and how you can identify when a problem is amenable to using a recursive method.

# Objective 04 - Trace and accurately identify the output of a recursive function call

## **Overview**

### **What is a stack?**

A stack is a straightforward data structure.

Let's start with an example. Imagine you're throwing a dinner party. You have a bunch of tasks to get done before your friends start arriving. One method for tracking your to-do items would be to write your tasks on sticky notes and place them in a pile. To decide what to work on next, you'd take the top sticky note off the pile and discard it after you complete it. If you think of another task to perform in the course of your work, you'd write out a new sticky note and place it on top of the pile.

So, there are two ways of interacting with a stack: you can **pop** the top item off or **push** an item onto the top.

### **What is the call stack?**

The whole reason we are talking about stacks in the first place is so we can understand the call stack. Call stacks help us understand recursion.

Whenever your program calls a function, the computer sets aside a chunk of memory for its execution context. Any variables in that function scope are stored here.

The computer stores these chunks of memory in the call stack, which has two fundamental operations: pushing onto the top and popping off the stack's top. The computer pushes a chunk on the stack when a function is called. The computer pops a piece off when a function finishes executing and returns. Let's look at a simple example.

We have two functions defined in our scope — one to add 2 to our input, and another to add 4.

```
def add_two(num):
    return num + 2

def add_four(num):
    return add_two(add_two(num))
```

Let's think about what the call stack looks like when we call these functions. First, what happens when we run the following:

```
add_two(2)
add_four(6)
```

1. `add_two` call gets pushed onto the call stack
2. `num` gets stored in memory with the value `2`
3. `num + 2` gets returned as `4` and that call gets popped off
4. `add_four` call gets pushed on the stack, and `6` gets stored as `num`
5. the innermost `add_two` call gets pushed onto the stack, and `6` gets stored as `num`
6. the innermost `add_two` call returns `8` and pops off
7. the second `add_two` call gets pushed onto the stack with `8` as `num`
8. the second `add_two` call
9. returns `10` and gets popped off
10. we are back in the context of `add_four`, which now returns `10` and pops off the stack
11. the stack is now empty

## **Follow Along**

### **Fibonacci**

Next, we look at the Fibonacci Sequence. (Here is an[interesting talk (Links to an external site.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjSHVDfXHQ4)about the Fibonacci Sequence.)

![https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/images/play_overlay.png](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/images/play_overlay.png)

This is a series of numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

We can derive the next number in the sequence by summing the previous two numbers — so the following number in the series shown above would be 55 (34 + 21).

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/982e288b65799cff6f3d5862100f2041bf923a69/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f39636238626137322d356135342d346636632d613335362d3337383363363436373435355f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d4f322d4669626f6e616363692e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/982e288b65799cff6f3d5862100f2041bf923a69/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f39636238626137322d356135342d346636632d613335362d3337383363363436373435355f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d4f322d4669626f6e616363692e676966)

We can write the Fibonacci Sequence like this:

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/11b345d18f3d9eb0194d74eb320730d6a2339060/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f39313762643461392d623938662d343133662d613239322d3864626665396536376361305f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d4669626f6e616363692d53657175656e63652d5461626c652e3030312e6a706567](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/11b345d18f3d9eb0194d74eb320730d6a2339060/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f39313762643461392d623938662d343133662d613239322d3864626665396536376361305f53322d4d322d496c6c757374726174696f6e732d4669626f6e616363692d53657175656e63652d5461626c652e3030312e6a706567)

So we can write the 7th term as xn, and you can describe any term in the sequence as:

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/x*n%20%3D%20x*%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20x\_%7Bn-2%7D](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_n%20%3D%20x_%7Bn-1%7D%20%2B%20x_%7Bn-2%7D)

Using this rule, if you wanted to find the 10th term, you could write:

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/x*%7B10%7D%20%3D%20x*%7B10-1%7D%20%2B%20x\_%7B10-2%7D](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_%7B10%7D%20%3D%20x_%7B10-1%7D%20%2B%20x_%7B10-2%7D)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/x\_%7B10%7D%20%3D%20x_9%20%2B%20x_8](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_%7B10%7D%20%3D%20x_9%20%2B%20x_8)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/x\_%7B10%7D%20%3D%2034%20%2B%2021](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_%7B10%7D%20%3D%2034%20%2B%2021)

[https://i.upmath.me/svg/x\_%7B10%7D%20%3D%2055](https://i.upmath.me/svg/x_%7B10%7D%20%3D%2055)

It's easy to write a simple, naïve algorithm to find the nth term in the Fibonacci Sequence with the information above.

We can start with pseudocode.

```
recursive_fib(n):
    if n is less than or equal to 1
        return n
    otherwise
        return recursive_fib(n - 1) + recursive_fib(n - 2)
```

Luckily, since this is quite a simple algorithm, it is relatively trivial to convert into Python code.

```
def recursive_fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return recursive_fib(n-1) + recursive_fib(n-2)
```

The function now represents the rules for the sequence that we've gone over. The base cases are the first two terms in the sequence; the 0th term is 0, and the 1st term is 1. For every other term, we find the value by summing the previous two terms.

Despite having a good understanding of the function and the rule for the sequence, we may not have an excellent conceptual understanding of what happens with the call stack when the function gets called — let's inspect closer.

To more clearly illustrate the building of the stack, we will split our return statement up like this:

```
def recursive_fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        n_minus_1 = recursive_fib(n-1)
        n_minus_2 = recursive_fib(n-2)
        return n_minus_1 + n_minus_2
```

Now, let's find the 4th item in the sequence by calling `recursive_fib(4)`.

[https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7c7a4fb9dcff6de74a1ef4b0eb80ea0bb1826e05/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f36616630303732382d356162392d343031332d383933612d3633666439333236363463355f53322d4d322d4f322d5265637572736976652d4669622d43616c6c2d537461636b2e676966](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7c7a4fb9dcff6de74a1ef4b0eb80ea0bb1826e05/68747470733a2f2f746b2d6173736574732e6c616d6264617363686f6f6c2e636f6d2f36616630303732382d356162392d343031332d383933612d3633666439333236363463355f53322d4d322d4f322d5265637572736976652d4669622d43616c6c2d537461636b2e676966)

It might help watch the call stack animation above several times until you understand what is happening. It can take some time, but eventually, it clicks, and it makes all future recursion problems easier when it does.

The stack gets kicked off by the first `recursive_fib(4)` call. Then, on line 5, `recursive_fib(3)` gets pushed onto the stack. Then, `recursive_fib(2)` and `recursive_fib(1)`. We are finally at a base case. That means we should be able to return and pop something off the stack. We do, and `recursive_fib(1)` returns `1` and pops off the stack. We are now on line 6 in the context of the `recursive_fib(2)` call. Now, we push `recursive_fib(0)` onto the stack, which returns `0` and immediately pops off. Again, in the context of `recursive_fib(2)`, we can now return our sum of `n_minus_1` and `n_minus_2`. These values are `1` and `0` respectively, so we return `1` and pop `recursive_fib(2)` off the stack.

Now, we are in the context of `recursive_fib(3)`, and we push `recursive_fib(1)`, which returns `1` and pops off. We can now return from `recursive_fib(3)` with `1 + 1` or `2`.

Next, in the context of `recursive_fib(4)`, we push `recursive_fib(2)` onto the stack. You should notice here that we have to repeat what we previously did when we pushed `recursive_fib(2)` to get to `1 + 0` or `1`. *This should get you thinking of what you would do differently in a recursive function to prevent this repeat behavior.*

Once we repetitiously build and tear down the stack to get `1`, we are ready to return from our `recursive_fib(4)` context. We return `2 + 1` or `3`, pop `recursive_fib(4)` off the stack, and now our call stack is empty.

Here is another way to visualize what is happening as we build and tear down the stack:

## **Challenge**

1. You are still learning the ins and outs of recursion, so suppose you end up making a mistake and writing a recursive function that runs forever. Your computer separates a spot in memory on the call stack for each function call. What ends up happening to the stack when your recursive function keeps running forever?
2. What two operations does a stack have?
3. Where do all function calls go?
4. I am tasking you with tiling a 2" x 16" area of the floor. The tiles you are using are 1" x 2". How many ways are there to cover the area with tiles? *See three possible layouts in the image below.*

# Objective 05 - Write a binary search algorithm

## **Overview**

Let's return to a previous example where we talked about a guessing game. The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 20, and you have to guess which number. After each guess, the computer will respond with "too high," "too low," or "correct."

Can you think of a different strategy than the one that we used last time? Since the computer gives us valuable information after each guess, we get to eliminate several possibilities after each guess. For instance, if we guessed the middle value "10" and the computer responded with "too high," we could eliminate 10-20 from our pool of possible numbers (reducing the number of possibilities by roughly half).

If we guess 5 (the middle value of the remaining possibilities), and the computer responds with "too low," we can now eliminate 1-5 and are left with just 6-9. We would continue guessing in this fashion until the computer responded with "correct."

This process of halving the number of possibilities with each guess is called a **binary search**. This halving has a time complexity of `O(log n)`, which is much more efficient than linear search, which has a complexity of `O(n)`.

## **Follow Along**

Let's now try to turn our understanding of a binary search into pseudocode. We are trying to define a function that can take an `array` of elements and the `target` element that we are seeking.

```
# 1. Declare min = 0 and max = length of array - 1
# 2. Figure out the guess value by getting the middle integer between min and max
# 3. if array[guess] equals the target, we found the element, return the index
# 4. if the guess was too low, reset min to be one more than the guess
# 5. if the guess was too high, reset max to be one less than the guess
# 6. go back to step 2
```

Let's now start to try turning this pseudocode into working Python code:

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    # 1. Declare min = 0 and max = length of array - 1
    min = 0
    max = len(array) - 1
    # 2. Figure out the guess value by getting the middle integer between min and max
    guess = (max + min) // 2
    # 3. if array[guess] equals the target, we found the element, return the index
    if array[guess] == target:
        return guess
    # 4. if the guess was too low, reset min to be one more than the guess
    elif array[guess] < target:
        min = guess + 1
    # 5. if the guess was too high, reset max to be one less than the guess
    else:
        max = guess - 1
    # 6. go back to step 2
```

We've been able to get this far in our pseudocode, but now we realize that "go back to step 2" will have to be a type of looping construct. But what kind of loop? Should we use a for loop? A while loop? A for loop doesn't make sense here because the way we are iterating through our collection is a little different; we aren't incrementing our index by one after each loop. A while loop would work, but what condition do we want to check at each loop's outset? In other words, how will we know when we've finished investigating all possibilities? If our max pointer is ever less than our min pointer. At that point, we would understand that we've already guessed all options. Let's make some changes to our code.

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    # 1. Declare min = 0 and max = length of array - 1
    min = 0
    max = len(array) - 1
    while not max < min:
        # 2. Figure out the guess value by getting the middle integer between min and max
        guess = (max + min) // 2
        # 3. if array[guess] equals the target, we found the element, return the index
        if array[guess] == target:
            return guess
        # 4. if the guess was too low, reset min to be one more than the guess
        elif array[guess] < target:
            min = guess + 1
        # 5. if the guess was too high, reset max to be one less than the guess
        else:
            max = guess - 1
```

The last thing we need to decide is what to do if we make it through our loop without finding a match for our target. Let's go ahead and return `-1`.

```
def binary_search(array, target):
    # 1. Declare min = 0 and max = length of array - 1
    min = 0
    max = len(array) - 1
    while not max < min:
        # 2. Figure out the guess value by getting the middle integer between min and max
        guess = (max + min) // 2
        # 3. if array[guess] equals the target, we found the element, return the index
        if array[guess] == target:
            return guess
        # 4. if the guess was too low, reset min to be one more than the guess
        elif array[guess] < target:
            min = guess + 1
        # 5. if the guess was too high, reset max to be one less than the guess
        else:
            max = guess - 1
    # no match was found
    return -1
```

## **Challenge**

1. What is the time complexity of our `binary_search` function above?
2. Can you turn the function above into a recursive function? Any variables tracked/updated in the while loop will have to become parameters for the recursive function.
