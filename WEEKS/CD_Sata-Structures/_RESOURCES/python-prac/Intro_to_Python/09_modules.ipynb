Packages have the advantage of allowing the import of all the files at once, rather than each file individually.\n",

All of them will excecute and import the entire namespace of the target, even when it doesn't seem like it. The names are there, in memory no matter which style you choose - but they may or may not be injected into your namespace. This choice is not about memory, it's about namespace clutter. The following example is prefered because it causes the least namespace clutter."

At small scale this is not a problem, but it can become a problem if you have many imports in a large project.\n",

Worse case: we can no longer be sure that we're not creating name conflicts. Don't use star imports in production code. It's fine if it's the only import in a single module, and no one but you will ever read it, but it's still bad form."
