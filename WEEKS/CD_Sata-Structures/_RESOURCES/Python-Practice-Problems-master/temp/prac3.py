# Problem 3
# Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
# Extras:
# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
