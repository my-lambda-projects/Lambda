# Problem 2
# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
# Extras:
# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
# Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
