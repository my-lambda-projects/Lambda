## Learning Python 3

This gist provides the [learning-python3.ipynb][] notebook file, which can be viewed and edited in a [Jupyter Notebook][] server to learn [Python 3][].

Once you load the notebook file to your local jupyter server, you can edit any of the cells, add new cells, or delete cells. The **code cells** will let you type and execute Python code (since we are using the Python 3 **kernel**). The **markdown cells** will let you type notes with a simple syntax.
