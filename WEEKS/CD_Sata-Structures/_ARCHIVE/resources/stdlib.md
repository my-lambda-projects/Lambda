### Operating System Interface

The os module provides dozens of functions for interacting with the operating system:

> > > import os os.getcwd\(\) \# Return the current working directory 'C:\Python39' os.chdir\('/server/accesslogs'\) \# Change current working directory os.system\('mkdir today'\) \# Run the command mkdir in the system shell 0

Be sure to use the `import os` style instead of `from os import *`. This will keep os.open from shadowing the built-in open function which operates much differently.

The built-in dir and help functions are useful as interactive aids for working with large modules like os:

> > > import os dir\(os\) help\(os\) &lt;returns an extensive manual page created from the module's docstrings&gt;

For daily file and directory management tasks, the shutil module provides a higher level interface that is easier to use:

> > > import shutil shutil.copyfile\('data.db', 'archive.db'\) 'archive.db' shutil.move\('/build/executables', 'installdir'\) 'installdir'

### File Wildcards

The glob module provides a function for making file lists from directory wildcard searches:

> > > import glob glob.glob\('\*.py'\) \['primes.py', 'random.py', 'quote.py'\]

### Command Line Arguments

Common utility scripts often need to process command line arguments. These arguments are stored in the sys module's _argv_ attribute as a list. For instance the following output results from running `python demo.py one two three` at the command line:

> > > import sys print\(sys.argv\) \['demo.py', 'one', 'two', 'three'\]

The argparse module provides a more sophisticated mechanism to process command line arguments. The following script extracts one or more filenames and an optional number of lines to be displayed:

```text
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog = 'top',
    description = 'Show top lines from each file')
parser.add_argument('filenames', nargs='+')
parser.add_argument('-l', '--lines', type=int, default=10)
args = parser.parse_args()
print(args)
```

When run at the command line with `python top.py --lines=5 alpha.txt beta.txt`, the script sets `args.lines` to `5` and `args.filenames` to `['alpha.txt', 'beta.txt']`.

### Error Output Redirection and Program Termination

The sys module also has attributes for _stdin_, _stdout_, and _stderr_. The latter is useful for emitting warnings and error messages to make them visible even when _stdout_ has been redirected:

> > > sys.stderr.write\('Warning, log file not found starting a new one\n'\) Warning, log file not found starting a new one

The most direct way to terminate a script is to use `sys.exit()`.

### String Pattern Matching

The re module provides regular expression tools for advanced string processing. For complex matching and manipulation, regular expressions offer succinct, optimized solutions:

> > > import re re.findall\(r'\bf\[a-z\]\*', 'which foot or hand fell fastest'\) \['foot', 'fell', 'fastest'\] re.sub\(r'\(\b\[a-z\]+\) \1', r'\1', 'cat in the the hat'\) 'cat in the hat'

When only simple capabilities are needed, string methods are preferred because they are easier to read and debug:

> > > 'tea for too'.replace\('too', 'two'\) 'tea for two'

### Mathematics

The math module gives access to the underlying C library functions for floating point math:

> > > import math math.cos\(math.pi / 4\) 0.70710678118654757 math.log\(1024, 2\) 10.0

The random module provides tools for making random selections:

> > > import random random.choice\(\['apple', 'pear', 'banana'\]\) 'apple' random.sample\(range\(100\), 10\) \# sampling without replacement \[30, 83, 16, 4, 8, 81, 41, 50, 18, 33\] random.random\(\) \# random float 0.17970987693706186 random.randrange\(6\) \# random integer chosen from range\(6\) 4

The statistics module calculates basic statistical properties \(the mean, median, variance, etc.\) of numeric data:

> > > import statistics data = \[2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5\] statistics.mean\(data\) 1.6071428571428572 statistics.median\(data\) 1.25 statistics.variance\(data\) 1.3720238095238095

The SciPy project \[&lt;[https://scipy.org\]\(%3Chttps://scipy.org\)&gt;](https://scipy.org]%28%3Chttps://scipy.org%29&gt); has many other modules for numerical computations.

### Internet Access

There are a number of modules for accessing the internet and processing internet protocols. Two of the simplest are urllib.request for retrieving data from URLs and smtplib for sending mail:

> > > from urllib.request import urlopen with urlopen\('[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl](http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl)'\) as response: ... for line in response: ... line = line.decode\('utf-8'\) \# Decoding the binary data to text. ... if 'EST' in line or 'EDT' in line: \# look for Eastern Time ... print\(line\)

```text
<BR>Nov. 25, 09:43:32 PM EST

>>> import smtplib
>>> server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
>>> server.sendmail('soothsayer@example.org', 'jcaesar@example.org',
... """To: jcaesar@example.org
... From: soothsayer@example.org
...
... Beware the Ides of March.
... """)
>>> server.quit()
```

\(Note that the second example needs a mailserver running on localhost.\)

### Dates and Times

The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient member extraction for output formatting and manipulation. The module also supports objects that are timezone aware. :

> > > ## dates are easily constructed and formatted
> > >
> > > from datetime import date now = date.today\(\) now datetime.date\(2003, 12, 2\) now.strftime\("%m-%d-%y. %d %b %Y is a %A on the %d day of %B."\) '12-02-03. 02 Dec 2003 is a Tuesday on the 02 day of December.'
> > >
> > > ## dates support calendar arithmetic
> > >
> > > birthday = date\(1964, 7, 31\) age = now - birthday age.days 14368

### Data Compression

Common data archiving and compression formats are directly supported by modules including: zlib, gzip, bz2, lzma, zipfile and tarfile. :

> > > import zlib s = b'witch which has which witches wrist watch' len\(s\) 41 t = zlib.compress\(s\) len\(t\) 37 zlib.decompress\(t\) b'witch which has which witches wrist watch' zlib.crc32\(s\) 226805979

### Performance Measurement

Some Python users develop a deep interest in knowing the relative performance of different approaches to the same problem. Python provides a measurement tool that answers those questions immediately.

For example, it may be tempting to use the tuple packing and unpacking feature instead of the traditional approach to swapping arguments. The timeit module quickly demonstrates a modest performance advantage:

> > > from timeit import Timer Timer\('t=a; a=b; b=t', 'a=1; b=2'\).timeit\(\) 0.57535828626024577 Timer\('a,b = b,a', 'a=1; b=2'\).timeit\(\) 0.54962537085770791

In contrast to timeit's fine level of granularity, the profile and pstats modules provide tools for identifying time critical sections in larger blocks of code.

### Quality Control

One approach for developing high quality software is to write tests for each function as it is developed and to run those tests frequently during the development process.

The doctest module provides a tool for scanning a module and validating tests embedded in a program's docstrings. Test construction is as simple as cutting-and-pasting a typical call along with its results into the docstring. This improves the documentation by providing the user with an example and it allows the doctest module to make sure the code remains true to the documentation:

```text
def average(values):
    """Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.

    >>> print(average([20, 30, 70]))
    40.0
    """
    return sum(values) / len(values)

import doctest
doctest.testmod()   # automatically validate the embedded tests
```

The unittest module is not as effortless as the doctest module, but it allows a more comprehensive set of tests to be maintained in a separate file:

```text
import unittest

class TestStatisticalFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_average(self):
        self.assertEqual(average([20, 30, 70]), 40.0)
        self.assertEqual(round(average([1, 5, 7]), 1), 4.3)
        with self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):
            average([])
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            average(20, 30, 70)

unittest.main()  # Calling from the command line invokes all tests
```

### Batteries Included

Python has a "batteries included" philosophy. This is best seen through the sophisticated and robust capabilities of its larger packages. For example:

- The xmlrpc.client and xmlrpc.server modules make implementing remote

  procedure calls into an almost trivial task. Despite the modules

  names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.

- The email package is a library for managing email messages,

  including MIME and other 2822-based message documents. Unlike

  smtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the

  email package has a complete toolset for building or decoding

  complex message structures \(including attachments\) and for

  implementing internet encoding and header protocols.

- The json package provides robust support for parsing this popular

  data interchange format. The csv module supports direct reading and

  writing of files in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly supported

  by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by the

  xml.etree.ElementTree, xml.dom and xml.sax packages. Together, these

  modules and packages greatly simplify data interchange between

  Python applications and other tools.

- The sqlite3 module is a wrapper for the SQLite database library,

  providing a persistent database that can be updated and accessed

  using slightly nonstandard SQL syntax.

- Internationalization is supported by a number of modules including

  gettext, locale, and the codecs package.
