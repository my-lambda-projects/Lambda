      There are many systems in the natural world and in society that are
      amenable to mathematical and computational modeling. However, not
      everything is easily codified as a system of particles with coordinates
      and momenta. Some systems and problems such as social networks, ecologies,
      and genetic regulatory schemes are intrinsically divorced from spacetime
      descriptions, and instead are more naturally expressed as graphs that
      reflect their topological properties. At their simplest, graphs are simply
      collections of nodes – representing some class of objects like people,
      corporate boards, proteins, or destinations on the globe – and edges,
      which serve to represent connections like friendships, bridges, or
      molecular binding interactions.

      Consider the highway system of the eastern coast of the United States. A
      road inspector is given the task of writing reports about the current
      condition of each highway. What would be the most economical way for him
      to traverse all the cities? The problem can be modeled as a graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, since graphs are dots and lines , they look like road maps. The
      dots are called vertices or nodes and the lines are called edges. They may
      have a value assigned to them (weighted) or they may just be a mere
      indicator of the existence of a path (unweighted). More formally, a graph
      can be defined as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A graph GG consists of a set of VV of <em>vertices</em> (or
        <em>nodes</em>) and a set EE of edges (or <em>arcs</em>) such that each
        edge e Ee∈E is associated with a pair of vertices V∈V. A graph GG with
        vertices VV and edges EE is written as G=(V,E)G=(V,E).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Because graphs are so pervasive, it is useful to define different types of
      graphs. The following are the most common types of graphs:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Undirected graph:</strong> An undirected graph is one in which its
      edges have no orientations, i.e. no direction is associated with any edge.
      The edges (x,y)(x,y) and (y,x)(y,x) are equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Directed graph:</strong> A directed graph or digraph GG consists
      of a set VV of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges (or arcs) such that
      each edge e Ee∈E is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. If there
      is an edge (x,y)(x,y), it is completely distinct from the edge (y,x)(y,x).
    </p>

      />Undirected graphs are typically represented by a line with no arrows,
      which implies a bidirectional relationship between node A and node B.
      Directed graphs use an arrow to show the relationship from A to B.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Directed acyclic graph</strong>: A directed acyclic graph
      (commonly abbreviated as DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles.
      A cycle is any path {A_1, , A_n}{A1​,…,An​} such that the edges
      A_1A_2A1​→A2​, A_2A_3A2​→A3​, …, and A_nA_1An​→A1​ all exist, thus forming
      a loop. A DAG is a graph without a single cycle.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        List all the edges and vertices of the undirected graph GG in the figure
        above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The graph GG consists of the set of vertices VV = {Massachusetts, Maine,
        Connecticut, New York, Maryland, New Jersey}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its edges are E =E= {(Maine,Massachusetts) , (Massachusetts,
        Connecticut) , (Connecticut,New York), (New York,Maine), (New
        York,Massachusetts), (New Jersey, Maine),(Maryland, New York), (Maine,
        Maryland)}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that since the graph is undirected, the order of the tuples in
        denoting the edges is unimportant. _□​

      Government surveillance agencies have a tendency to accumulate strange new

      has the ability to monitor the communications of suspected individuals as
      well as the communications of people within some number of hops of any
      suspect. In the communication network above, which person is connected to
      the greatest number of people through 1 hop or less?

    <p>
      Above we represented a graph by drawing it. To represent it in a computer,
      however, we need more formal ways of representing graphs. Here we discuss
      the two most common ways of representing a graph: the adjacency matrix and
      the adjacency list.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The adjacency matrix</strong></p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/TxDs837ybO-adjacency.png?width=1200"
      />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Represent the graph above using an adjacency matrix.</p>
      <p>
        To obtain the adjacency matrix of the graph, we first label the rows and
        columns with the corresponding ordered vertices. If there exists an edge
        between two vertices ii and jj, then their corresponding cell in the
        matrix will be assigned 11. If there does not exist an edge, then the
        cell will be assigned the value 00. The adjacency matrix for the graph
        above is thus
      </p>

      <p>.  _⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡​abcde​a01101​b10000​c10011​d00100​e10100​⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎤​. □​</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Adjacency list</strong></p>
    <p>
      An adjacency list representation of a graph is a way of associating each
      vertex (or node) in the graph with its respective list of neighboring
      vertices. A common way to do this is to create a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hash_table">Hash table</a>. This
      table will contain each vertice as a key and the list of adjacent vertices
      of that vertices as a value.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our example above, the adjacency list representation will look as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/brioche/uploads/nyyytOJDUh-adj-list.png?width=1200"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      We can see that the adjacency list is much less expensive on memory as the
      adjacency matrix is very sparse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most graph algorithms involve visiting each vertex in VV, starting from a
      root node v_0v0​. There are several ways of achieving this. The two most
      common traversal algorithms are breadth-first search and depth-first
      search.
    </p>
    <h3 id="breadth-first-search">Breadth-first Search</h3>
    <p>
      In a
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/breadth-first-search-bfs/"
        >breadth-first search</a
      >, we start with the start node, followed by its adjacent nodes, then all
      nodes that can be reached by a path from the start node containing two
      edges, three edges, and so on. Formally the BFS algorithm visits all
      vertices in a graph GG, that are kk edges away from the source vertex ss
      before visiting any vertex k+1k+1 edges away. This is done until no more
      vertices are reachable from ss. The image below demonstrates exactly how
      this traversal proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://ds055uzetaobb.cloudfront.net/uploads/Dnf4nQwvZW-breadth-first-gif.gif"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      For a graph G = (V,E)G=(V,E) and a source vertex vv, breadth-first search
      traverses the edges of GG to find all reachable vertices from vv. It also
      computes the shortest distance to any reachable vertex. Any path between
      two points in a breadth-first search tree corresponds to the shortest path
      from the root vv to any other node ss.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may think of three types of vertices in BFS as <em>tree</em> verties,
      those that have been taken of the data structure.
      <em>fringe</em> vertices, those adjacent to tree vertices but not yet
      visited, and <em>undiscovered</em> vertices, those that we have not
      encountered yet. If each visited vertex is connected to the edge that
      caused it to be added to the data structure, then these edges form a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      To search a connected component of a graph systematically, we begin with
      one vertex on the fringe, all others unseen, and perform the following
      step until all vertices have been visited: “move one vertex xx from the
      fringe to the tree, and put any unseen vertices adjacent to xx on the
      fringe.” Graph traversal methods differ in how it is decided which vertex
      should be moved from the fringe to the tree. For breadth-first search we
      want to choose the vertex from the fringe that was least recently
      encountered; this corresponds to using a queue to hold vertices on the
      fringe.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What is the state of the queue at each iteration of BFS, if it is called
        from node ‘a’?

        DFS. In this example all of them.

      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/depth-first-search-dfs/"
        >Depth-ﬁrst search</a
      >
      explores edges out of the most recently discovered vertex ss  that still
      has unexplored edges leaving it. Once all of ’s edges have been explored,
      the search “backtracks” to explore edges leaving the vertex from which 
      was discovered. This process continues until we have discovered all the
      vertices that are reachable from the original source vertex. If any
      undiscovered vertices remain, then depth-ﬁrst search selects one of them
      as a new source, and it repeats the search from that source. The algorithm
      repeats this entire process until it has discovered every vertex:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit a vertex ss.</li>
      <li>Mark ss as visited.</li>

    <h3 id="contrasting-traversals">Contrasting Traversals</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to tree traversal, the code for breadth-first search is slightly
      different from depth-first search. The most commonly mentioned difference
      is that BFS uses a queue to store alternative choices instead of a stack.
      This small change however leads to a classical graph traversal algorithm.
      Depth-first search goes down a single path until the path leads to the
      goal or we reach a limit. When a path is completely explored we back
      track. BFS however explores all paths from the starting location at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we increase the size of our graph, the contrast between depth-first and
      breadth-first search is quite evident. Depth-first search explores the
      graph by looking for new vertices far away from the start point, taking
      closer vertices only when dead ends are encountered; breadth-first search
      completely covers the area close to the starting point, moving farther
      away only when everything close has been looked at. Again, the order in
      which the nodes are visited depends largely upon the effects of this
      ordering on the order in which vertices appear on the adjacency lists.

      />John lives in the Trees of Ten Houses, and it is a most ideal and
      idyllic place for him and the other dwellers up in the canopy. They have
      invested a tremendous amount of time in engineering these houses, and to
      ensure no house felt isolated from the others, they built a fresh, finely
      crafted bridge between each and every house!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the Trees of Ten Houses were not immune to thunderstorms,
      nor were the bridges well engineered. The night was treacherous, howling
      with wind and freezing with rain, so the odds for the bridges were not
      good–each bridge seemed just as likely to survive as to be shattered!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, as there were so very many bridges in the Trees of Ten
      Houses, when John did wake the following morning, he found he was able to
      make his way to each and every house using only the existing bridges,
      though round-about routes may have been necessary. As they began
      rebuilding, John became curious… what were the chances that they’d all be
      so lucky?
    </p>
    <p>
      More formally, if PP is the probability that, after the storm, John is
      able to traverse to each and every house, what is 10^{10} P ?⌊1010P⌋?
    </p>
    <p><strong>Details and Assumptions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Trees of Ten Houses do, in fact, contain precisely 10 houses.</li>
      <li>
        Before the storm, there exists a single bridge between each and every
        unique pair of houses.
      </li>
      <li>The storm destroys each bridge with independent probability 21​.</li>
      <li>
        John is allowed to traverse through others’ houses to try to reach all
        of them, but he must only use the surviving bridges to get there. No
        vine swinging allowed.
