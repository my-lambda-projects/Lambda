      Let’s face it, learning to <em>write</em> computer programs is
      <em>hard</em>. Doing so involves picking up a lot of specialized skills
      and jargon, most of which is unfamiliar, and it also means cultivating a
      mental approach to the world that, at first, might seem downright
      <em>alien</em>. It’s a long journey, but fluency starts with learning how
      to <em>read</em> computer programs, and that <em>really</em> shouldn’t be
      so hard.

      One of the defining traits of the Python programming language is that it’s
      <em>designed</em> to be readable by humans. For the most part it fulfills
      that promise, however, after several years of helping others understand
      Python, I’ve come to realize that there’s an important caveat to that
      statement; it’s really only true for someone with a
      <em>significant</em> and <em>specialized</em> English-language vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is you need enough mastery of the “rules” of English grammar and
      wordplay to recognize and understand, at a glance, words
      <em>written</em> in English that <em>are not</em> actually words you’ll
      find in an English dictionary. Nonstandard terms like
      <strong>def</strong> (a <em>contraction</em
      ><a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#fn:1"
        >1</a
      >), <strong>elif</strong> (a <em>portmanteau</em>) and
      <strong>nonlocal</strong> (a <em>neologism</em>) all abound, so even for
      those with quite advanced <em>native</em> English fluency the task of
      learning Python is very much like trying to learn a foreign language
      that’s <em>slightly</em> related to their native tongue. For those without
      that fluency learning Python is like learning a foreign language
      <em>inside</em> a foreign language, and is therefore <em>far</em> more
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make that task a little easier I’m going to try, in this post and the
      ones that follow, to shed some light on the meaning of – and a
      <em>little</em> of the etymological history behind – the fundamental units
      of Python fluency. In this first part we will start with the most basic of
      those units, Python’s 35 <em>reserved keywords</em
      ><a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#fn:2"
        >2</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s right; the core vocabulary of Python you actually <em>need</em> to
      know to start to do meaningful work is just 35 keywords. It’s not the
      smallest language, but it’s <em>far</em> from the largest, and just
      compare it to the roughly 10,000 words required to achieve basic
      <em>native</em> fluency in a non-programming language.

      Python is what is known as a <em>statement</em>-oriented language; but
      what <em>is</em> a statement? Well, for the purposes of this article we’re
      just going to say that in Python a statement is a <em>single</em> line of
      code that does <em>something</em>. <em>What</em> it does, specifically,
      depends on the building blocks of that statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what are those building blocks? Well, let’s define them quickly and
      <em>very</em> roughly, since we’ll go into more detail about them in later
      posts. I’ll use UPPERCASE letters to make it easier to visually
      distinguish these abstract forms from the specific instances we’ll talk
      about later.KEYWORDA reserved <em>word</em> the meaning of which
      <em>cannot</em> be changed by the user. We will visit all 35 of these in
      the next section of this article.OPERATORA reserved <em>symbol</em> that
      indicates an action to be performed. For example, <code>=</code> is the
      <em>assignment</em> OPERATOR and <code>+</code> is the
      <em>addition</em> OPERATOR. There are quite a few others, but we’ll save
      them for the next post. A small number of KEYWORDs behave like OPERATORs,
      and I’ll point those out below.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are both provided by Python and you can’t directly change their
      meaning, which means that they’re somewhat inflexible. To do most work
      you’ll need something more flexible, which is why Python gives you the
      ability to represent <em>anything</em>.OBJECTAn individual
      <em>thing</em> you can interact with. Unlike KEYWORDs and OPERATORs, you
      can directly manipulate these, though the degree to which you can
      manipulate them depends on what <em>type</em> of OBJECT they are. You can
      also use KEYWORDs to define entirely new <em>types</em>, which makes them
      a very expressive way of building new <em>things</em> of your own. So
      expressive, in fact, that practically speaking <em>everything</em> you
      interact with in Python will be an OBJECT.
    </p>
    <p>
      That can be a bit abstract and hard to wrap your head around at this
      point, though. For now just know that OBJECTs tend to fall into three main
      categories.VALUEAn OBJECT that represents a single, concrete
      <em>thing</em>; for the purposes of this discussion what that thing
      actually <em>is</em> is irrelevant, but as an example, <code>4</code> is a
      VALUE of the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int"
        ><strong>int</strong></a
      >
      (short for <em>integer</em>) type and <code>hello</code> is a VALUE of the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str"
        ><strong>str</strong></a
      >
      (short for <em>string</em>) type. These are both examples of
      <em>primitive</em> types, which have a single meaningful value, but there
      are also <em>composite</em> types for describing things the meaning of
      which is defined by more than one <em>attribute</em>. A real-world example
      would be a rectangle, which cannot be defined without both height and
      width. As you’ll see below three special KEYWORDs all behave like VALUEs,
      though as before you cannot change their meaning.COLLECTIONAn OBJECT that
      groups together or contains other OBJECTs; there are
      <em>many</em> different types of COLLECTIONs in Python, but for the moment
      all we care about is that a COLLECTION <em>contains</em> zero or more
      OBJECTs. For example the statement <code>[2, 3, 4]</code> creates a
      COLLECTION of the type
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list"
        ><strong>list</strong></a
      >
      that holds three VALUEs inside of it. A COLLECTION can contain
      <em>any</em> OBJECT, so you can <em>nest</em> a COLLECTION inside another
      COLLECTION.CALLABLEAn OBJECT that represents some action to perform: it
      performs that action when you call it with some number of
      <em>arguments</em> then it <em>returns</em> (or gives back) an OBJECT. For
      instance
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum"
        ><strong>sum</strong></a
      >
      is a CALLABLE and when we call it using <code>sum([2, 3, 4])</code> it
      gives us back the VALUE <code>9</code>. There are several different kinds
      of CALLABLE, and we’ll touch on them in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wouldn’t be very efficient to type out the same OBJECT every time you
      needed to refer to it, though. It’s often very helpful to be able to refer
      to things <em>indirectly</em>.NAMEAny word that <em>is not</em> a KEYWORD,
      and that is used as an <em>alias</em> to <em>refer to</em> some specific
      OBJECT. Unlike a KEYWORD the meaning of a NAME <em>may</em> change over
      the course of a program, which is why these are often – if a little
      incorrectly – thought of as <em>variables</em>. There are several ways to
      create new NAMEs (and one to destroy them), as we’ll see below, but as a
      simple example in <code>number = 2</code> the <em>assignment</em> OPERATOR
      <strong>=</strong> creates the NAME <strong>number</strong> and assigns it
      to refer to the VALUE <strong>2</strong>. When later that is followed by
      <code>number += 2</code>, however, the
      <em>augmented assignment</em> OPERATOR <strong>+=</strong> will re-assign
      <strong>number</strong> to refer to <strong>4</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we’ve got all the simple building blocks defined and we can start
      organizing them into composite structures.EXPRESSIONAny composite form of
      one or more of the above that can be <em>evaluated</em> to an OBJECT. For
      example, <code>4</code>, <code>2 + 2</code>, <code>1 * 3 + 1</code> and
      <code>sum([1, 1, 1, 1])</code> are all EXPRESSIONs that evaluate to
      <code>4</code>. The EXPRESSION represents the smallest discrete unit of
      work in Python.STATEMENTAny single line of code that is composed of at
      least one of the above. These can get quite complex, but to
      <em>do</em> anything they’ll usually need to include KEYWORDs and/or
      OPERATORs plus EXPRESSIONs. You’ve already met a <em>useful</em> STATEMENT
      in <code>number = 2</code>. If you read each STATEMENT in a program out in
      turn you can track the program as it does its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      That covers any given <em>line</em> of code, but there are also a couple
      of higher level structures we need to define for the moment:BLOCKAt least
      two STATEMENTs that are bound together; the first STATEMENT will end in a
      <strong>:</strong> character and indicates the start of the BLOCK. The
      second and all further STATEMENTs inside that BLOCK will be indented
      further right than the initial STATEMENT, to indicate that they
      <em>belong</em> to the same BLOCK. The last such indented STATEMENT
      represents the end of the BLOCK.MODULEA single Python .py file; it’s
      composed of some number of STATEMENTS. All Python programs are comprised
      of at least one MODULE. As you’ll see below we write all of our
      functionality inside MODULEs, and we use KEYWORDs and NAMEs to
      <em>import</em> functionality from other MODULEs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many other concepts you’ll need to become familiar with, but
      with these building blocks we can investigate all 35 words in Python’s
      relatively small vocabulary, and thus understand the skeleton of any
      Python program.

      does nothing whatsoever; it exists solely to allow you to write a
      syntactically valid BLOCK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general meaning here comes from a Middle English verb borrowed via Old
      French from the Latin <em><strong>passus</strong></em> that implies
      <em>“to move by [a place, without stopping]”</em>. More specifically the
      meaning in Python is borrowed from its use in sequential-play card games
      such as Bridge, where if you do not wish to do anything on your turn you
      <em><strong>pass</strong></em> control of the game to the next player,
      doing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need for this is simple; once you begin a BLOCK in Python it
      <em>must</em> contain <em>at least one</em> indented STATEMENT to be
      considered valid syntax. The
      <a

      The next three keywords are specialized because they each behave like a
      primitive VALUE. This means they can be assigned to a NAME, kept within a
      COLLECTION, and can be the result of evaluating an EXPRESSION. They’re
      also the only keywords that start with a capital letter, which makes them
      easy to distinguish.

    <p><strong>boolean values</strong></p>

        ><code>True</code></a

      .
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Old English adjective <em><strong>triewe</strong></em
      >, which has German roots; the general meaning is of being “worthy of
      trust” and “consistent with fact”. In logic, though, the specific meaning
      is really just “that which is not false”, and in computer programming it’s
      usually a proxy for the binary digit 1.<a

        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      From late Old English, borrowed via the Old French
      <em><strong>faus</strong></em> from the Latin
      <em><strong>falsus</strong></em
      >; the general meaning is of “fake, incorrect, mistaken, or deceitful”. In
      logic the meaning is not so sinister, it just means “that which is not
      true”, and in computer programming it’s usually a proxy for the binary
      digit 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some lower-level languages you would probably just use
      <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> for these, but in Python they’ve been
      given special keywords to make it obvious that you’re working with the
      <em>logical</em> meaning instead of the <em>numerical</em> one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to understand that in Python <em>every</em> OBJECT (hence
      ever VALUE and COLLECTION, and therefore every EXPRESSION), has a
      <em>logical</em> value, in that it’s considered to be logically equivalent
      to either True or False. Testing the state of that logical value is known
      as
      <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing"
        >truth-value testing</a
      >, and as you’ll see below keywords like
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#and"
        ><code>and</code></a

    </p>
    <p>
      I will go into deeper detail about the specifics of truth-value testing in
      later articles, but for now you just need to know that most things are

        ><code>None</code></a

      <code>[]</code>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>the null value</strong></p>
    <p>
      This is most commonly used to represent the absence of any other VALUE.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      A Middle English pronoun from the Old English <em><strong>nan</strong></em
      >, meaning “not one” or “not any”. The meaning in programming, however,
      relates more to <em><strong>null</strong></em
      >, which means “not [any] thing” or just “nothing”. Python chose to use
      <em><strong>none</strong></em> because it’s a more commonly familiar word.
      It also helps to distinguish it from the use of the special value NULL in
      the C programming language, which has a similar meaning but behaves in a
      <em>very</em> different way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion of making <em>something</em> that explicitly represents
      <em>nothing</em> might seem a little odd, at first, but the need for

      A Middle English conjunction from the Old English
      <em><strong>gif</strong></em> which means, “in the event” or “whether” or,
      oddly, just “<em><strong>if</strong></em
      >”. Has many Scandinavian/Germanic relatives, and possibly arrives via an
      Old Norse term for “doubt, hesitation”. The general use is to make one
      word or phrase conditional on another being true, as in “<em>if</em> it is
      raining, open your umbrella”. The sense in computing is more formal but
      essentially the same; “<em>if</em> [this condition is true], then [do some
      action].<a

      Not a proper English word, but instead a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> that
      contracts <em><strong>else</strong></em> and
      <em><strong>if</strong></em> into a single artificial word,
      <em><strong>elif</strong></em
      >. Together it means “otherwise, if” or “as an alternative, if”, both of
      which imply that the action controlled by the
      <em><strong>elif</strong></em> is contingent on the outcome of some
      previous test or tests. So, in computing, “<em><strong>else</strong></em>
      [after checking some prior condition] <em><strong>if</strong></em> [this
      other condition is True], then [do some other action]“.<a

      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      An adverb from the Old English <em><strong>elles</strong></em
      >, meaning “[to do] instead of [some other action]” or “as an
      alternative”, or just “otherwise”. In computing it means “[check if any
      prior condition is true] <em><strong>else</strong></em> [perform some
      final action]“. It is used to take some default or fallback action when no
      better, more specific action should be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditionals are key to a lot of Python programming, and are needed to
      better explain some of the keywords that follow, so I’ll provide a few
      examples of how they work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes you only want to take <em>any</em> action if some condition is
      met; this is the simplest form:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>if EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Many situations are binary, though, and so you’ll always want to take some
      fallback action if the condition is <em>not</em> met:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>if EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENT_A
else:
    STATEMENT_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      In complex cases you may need to have any number of alternative actions
      based on mutually exclusive conditions, as well as a fallback:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>if EXPRESSION_A:
    STATEMENT_A
elif EXPRESSION_B:
    STATEMENT_B
else:
    STATEMENT_C</code></pre>
    <p>
      For the middle, “either/or” case there’s another form you will sometimes
      see, known as the <em>ternary operator</em> form. This is useful mainly
      because, unlike a standard
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#if"
        ><code>if</code></a
      >
      conditional, it behaves like an EXPRESSION, and the value it evaluates to
      can be directly assigned to a NAME:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>NAME = STATEMENT_A if EXPRESSION else STATEMENT_B</code></pre>
    <p>Which is a much shorter way of writing:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>if EXPRESSION:
    NAME = STATEMENT_A
else:
    NAME = STATEMENT_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      We’ll find this useful when we look at the OPERATOR-like keywords below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="five-that-are-operators">
      Five That Are Operators <a id="five-that-are-operators"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next five keywords all behave like an OPERATOR to denote actions
      performed on OBJECTs and/or EXPRESSIONS.
    </p>
    <p><strong>boolean logic operators</strong></p>
    <p>
      These are used for making meaningful comparisons between things based on
      their <em>truth-value</em>.<a

        >not</a

      >A <em>unary</em> OPERATOR that inverts the <em>truth-value</em> of
      whatever follows it, as in <code>not EXPRESSION</code>.Can be used to
      invert the meaning of another KEYWORD; see

        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#is"
        ><code>is not</code></a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#is-in"
        ><code>not in</code></a
      >
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Middle English adverb from the Old English
      <em><strong>nawiht</strong></em
      >, implying “nothing” or “zero”. The general meaning today negates (or
      flips) the meaning of the word or phrase that follows it. Compare “I do
      have apples” to “I do <em><strong>not</strong></em> have apples”. In
      programming, however, the specific meaning comes from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation">logical negation</a>, and
      thus <em><strong>not</strong></em> negates true to false, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Python’s <em>Boolean negation</em> OPERATOR, used whenever you
      need the opposite of the truth-value of a thing. It is <em>unary</em>,
      which means that it acts on whatever is to its immediate right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#not"
        ><code>not</code></a
      >
      is straightforward:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>not EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>
      If <code>EXPRESSION</code> is considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      then <code>not EXPRESSION</code> evaluates to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      and otherwise it evaluates to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      That can be easier to understand if you think of

    <p>
      An ancient Old English conjunction with Germanic roots vaguely meaning
      “thereupon” or “next [to]” and used to combine two words or phrases, as in
      “coffee <em><strong>and</strong></em> tea”. The meaning in Python,
      however, comes entirely from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction"
        >logical conjunction</a
      >, and implies that either <em>both</em> things it combines are true or
      the whole combination is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Python’s <em>Boolean conjunction</em> OPERATOR; used whenever you
      need to test if <em>both</em> sides of the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#and"
        ><code>and</code></a
      >
      are considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      . It is a <em>short-circuiting</em> operation; if the left-hand EXPRESSION
      is considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      the entire operation is considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      and the right-hand side will never be evaluated at all. And unlike
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#not"
        ><code>not</code></a
      >
      it does not necessarily evaluate to either
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a

        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      , evaluating instead to either the left side (if considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      ) or the right side.
    </p>
    <p>Thus the usage:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>EXPRESSION_A and EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      Can be thought of as working like the following <em>ternary</em>
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#if"
        ><code>if</code></a
      >
      :
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>EXPRESSION_B if EXPRESSION_A else EXPRESSION_A</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which is why you may one day find yourself surprised to find that
      <code>True and 1</code> evaluates to <code>1</code> while
      <code>1 and True</code> evaluates to
      <a

      Derived from the Old English conjunction <em><strong>oþþe</strong></em
      >, meaning “either”, and implying that either of the ideas conjoined are
      acceptable, as in “coffee <em><strong>or</strong></em> tea”. In Python the
      meaning comes from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction"
        >logical disjunction</a
      >, and implies that either <em>one</em> of the things it combines is true
      or the whole combination is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Python’s <em>Boolean disjunction</em> OPERATOR; used whenever you
      need to test if <em>either</em> side of the

        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      . It is a <em>short-circuiting</em> operation; if the left-hand EXPRESSION
      is considered
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      the entire operation is considered
      <a

        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      and the right-hand side will never be evaluated at all. Also, unlike
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#not"
        ><code>not</code></a
      >
      it does not necessarily evaluate to either
      <a

      ) or the right side.
    </p>
    <p>Thus the usage:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>EXPRESSION_A or EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>

    ><code>EXPRESSION_A if EXPRESSION_A else EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      This subtlety can catch you out when you find that

      operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Old English verb from the Germanic stem <em><strong>*es-</strong></em
      >; it’s the third person singular present indicative form of the word
      <em><strong>be</strong></em
      >, so it generally means “to be [a thing]“. In Python its meaning is
      specific to <em>identity</em>, and implies something more like “to be
      [some unique thing]“.
    </p>
    <p>The usage is straightforward:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>EXPRESSION_A is EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      And the usage with
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#not"
        ><code>not</code></a
      >
      is:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>EXPRESSION_A is not EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      The notion of <em>identity</em> is a little abstract, but think of it like
      this: Tom and Bob are twins, they’re the same height, age, and weight, and
      they share the same birthday, but they <em>do not</em> have the same
      identity. Tom is Tom, and Bob is Bob, but Tom is not Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most implementations of Python the identity of an OBJECT can be thought
      of as its unique address in memory, and since <em>every</em> OBJECT you
      work with will have its own unique address,
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#is"
        ><code>is</code></a
      >
      is usually only useful for telling if a NAME refers to a specific OBJECT:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>NAME is OBJECT
NAME is not OBJECT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Or for testing if two different NAMEs refer to the same OBJECT in memory.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>NAME is OTHER_NAME
NAME is not OTHER_NAME</code></pre>
    <p>
      There <em>are</em> however some special cases: for instance,
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      ,
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      , and
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      are all
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">singletons</a>
      in memory, meaning there is only <em>ever</em> one copy of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      in <em>any</em> Python program. For the most part this is just a
      space-saving detail you don’t need to worry about, but it explains why in
      Python we use <code>VALUE == True</code> and <em>not</em>
      <code>VALUE is True</code> when checking if something is considered
      <em>equivalent</em> to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      . Testing <em>identity</em> is <em>not</em> the same as testing
      <em>value</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason the uses of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#is"
        ><code>is</code></a
      >
      are limited and specific, which is why you’ll only rarely see

      <em><strong>in</strong></em
      >, meaning “among”, and <em><strong>inne</strong></em
      >, meaning “within” or “inside”. The merged word has many usages and
      meanings, but the general sense here is from the prepositional form, which
      implies that some thing is contained within or inside some larger thing,
      as in “a page <em><strong>in</strong></em> a book” or “a book
      <em><strong>in</strong></em> a library”. In Python it is specifically used
      for <em>membership testing</em>, when checking if an item is contained

    <p>
      The above keywords give you everything you need to perform simple decision
      making and to take basic actions, but they’re useless whenever you need to
      do something <em>repeatedly</em>; that’s where <em>looping</em> comes in.
      In Python the following four keywords give you everything you need to do
      that.
    </p>
    <p><strong>starting a loop</strong></p>
    <p>
      There are two ways to start a loop in Python, and they’re conceptually
      pretty similar, but your choice of which depends a great deal on exactly
      what you need to do with that loop.
    </p>
    <p><strong>looping until some condition is reached</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#while"
        >while</a
      ><a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement"
        >docs</a
      >Starts a loop BLOCK by testing a the truth-value of an EXPRESSION; will
      iterate continuously until EXPRESSION evaluates to False.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Old English word <em><strong>hwile</strong></em> for “a duration
      of time”, but here we’re using the conjunctive form which implies “[during
      the] time [that something is true]” or “for as long as [something is
      true]“. In programming languages the keyword is always associated with
      something to <em>test</em> and something to <em>do</em>, so the meaning
      becomes “<em><strong>while</strong></em> [the test is true], [do
      something]“.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#while"
        ><code>while</code></a
      >
      loop BLOCK is always the same:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>while EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      If the EXPRESSION evaluates as
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      then STATEMENT will be reached and executed. When the end of the indented
      BLOCK is reached, control returns immediately to the top, then EXPRESSION
      is tested again, and so on. So long as EXPRESSION evaluates as
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      the entire indented BLOCK will be run again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#while"
        ><code>while</code></a
      >
      loop can also <em>optionally</em> be terminated by an
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#else"
        ><code>else</code></a
      >
      BLOCK:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>while EXPRESSION:
    [...]
else:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this case the STATEMENT inside the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#else"
        ><code>else</code></a

      block will executed if the

        ><code>while</code></a
      >
      loop runs all the way to completion (its test evaluates to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"
        ><code>False</code></a
      >
      ) <em>without</em> encountering
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#break"
        ><code>break</code></a
      >
      . This can be useful when there is some cleanup action that needs to occur
      when a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#while"
        ><code>while</code></a
      >
      loop has exited naturally.

    <p>

        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#while"
        ><code>while</code></a
      >
      is the most basic form of loop, but it’s a little dangerous if not used
      with care. This is because any EXPRESSION that <em>always</em> evaluates
      as
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#true"
        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      will run <em>forever</em>. For this reason it’s generally important to
      design the EXPRESSION so that it will <em>eventually</em> evaluate to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#false"

    <p>
      An Old English word via the German <em><strong>für</strong></em> with a
      great many meanings; the general meaning is taken from a prepositional
      sense of “[performing an action] on behalf of [some thing]“. In computing,
      though, the meaning is actually taken from the contraction of the word
      <em><strong>for</strong></em> with either
      <em><strong>every</strong></em> (meaning “each [item] in a group”) or
      <em><strong>each</strong></em> (meaning “all [of a group]“) to form
      <em><strong>for every</strong></em> or <em><strong>for each</strong></em
      >, both of which mean “[to perform an action] on behalf of each item [in a
      group]“. In programming languages that descend from ALGOL
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop"
        ><em><strong>for</strong></em></a
      >
      has traditionally been the most common name for such a loop, with
      <em><strong>do</strong></em> used in a smaller number of languages. Python
      takes the name from the traditional usage in ALGOL via C, however it is
      more accurate to describe Python’s version as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach_loop"
        ><em><strong>foreach</strong></em></a
      >
      loop, because there is no explicit counter and the thing being looped over
      must be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration"><em>iterable</em></a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#for"
        ><code>for</code></a
      >
      consistently involves assigning a user-assigned NAME to every OBJECT
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#in"
        ><code>in</code></a
      >
      a COLLECTION.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>for NAME in COLLECTION:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Thus
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#for"
        ><code>for</code></a
      >
      every item in the COLLECTION the NAME will refer to that item
      <em>inside</em> the scope of the BLOCK; this allows the STATEMENT to use
      NAME to act on that thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be a little easier to grasp if you think of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#for"
        ><code>for</code></a

      as a specialized form of

        ><code>while</code></a

    <pre class="text"><code>while [items remain in COLLECTION to visit]:

    <p><strong>controlling a loop</strong></p>
    <p>
      You don’t always want to simply run the loop to completion; there may be
      good reason to exit early, or to skip a round of the loop.<a

      damage, destroy, or render unusable”, as in “to

      alternative meaning “to interrupt [a continuous sequence]“, as in “to
      <em><strong>break</strong></em> an electrical circuit”. In programming it
      specifically means to interrupt a loop from inside that loop.

      A Middle English verb borrowed via the Old French
      <em><strong>continuer</strong></em> from the Latin
      <em><strong>continuare</strong></em
      >. The general meaning used here is to “go forward or onward”, “carry on”,
      or “proceed”. In programming it means to cause a loop to start executing
      the next iteration, skipping any instructions that follow it.

      loop. The most common use is to skip to the next iteration of a loop
      immediately when some particular condition is reached:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>while True:
    if EXPRESSION:
        continue
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <pre class="text"><code>for NAME in COLLECTION:
    if EXPRESSION:
        continue
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is particularly useful if there’s some situation that warrants
      skipping the current loop; for example if you only wanted to act on every
      second iteration.

      All of the above, plus the <em>builtin</em> functions we’ll talk about in
      a later article, are sufficient to let you start using Python as a
      <em>scripting</em> language, where you glue together things others have
      written with your own code to do some task you want to accomplish. But you
      need to be able to access those “things others have written” to do so.
      That’s what Python’s <em>import mechanism</em> is for.<a

      >Used to bring the functionality of an external MODULE into your own code.
    </p>
    <p>
      A verb from the Middle English <em><strong>importen</strong></em
      >, via the Old French from the Latin <em><strong>importare</strong></em
      >. The general meaning is to “bring/carry [goods into this country] from
      abroad”. In computing it means to bring or
      <em><strong>import</strong></em> some functionality <em>exported</em> by
      another program written in the same language into the current program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common usage is very simple, the keyword is followed by the
      MODULE you want to access:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import MODULE</code></pre>
    <p>You can also import multiple MODULEs separated by commas:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import MODULE_A, MODULE_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      And for organizational purposes you can put parentheses around them as
      well:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import (MODULE_A, MODULE_B)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Any NAME inside the imported MODULE(s) can then be accessed within your
      own program using the <em>dot access</em> pattern in the form MODULE.NAME.
      So, for instance, if you wanted to get the circumference of a circle:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>import math

radius = 3
circumference = math.tau * radius</code></pre>
    <p>
      Usually you’ll find all the

      usage at the top of a MODULE, which makes it pretty easy to determine
      where such functionality comes from.<a

    <p>
      A Middle English word from the Old English <em><strong>fram</strong></em
      >, here we use the preposition form, with a general sense of “departure or
      movement away [from something]“; in computing we use a more specific sense
      of “taken <em><strong>from</strong></em> a source”.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s used to modify
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#import"
        ><code>import</code></a
      >
      to import a specific NAME from a MODULE, rather than the
      <em>entire</em> MODULE:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from MODULE import NAME</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you wish to import more than one NAME they can be separated by commas:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from MODULE import NAME_A, NAME_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      And for organizational purposes you can put parentheses around them as
      well:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from MODULE import (NAME_A, NAME_B)</code></pre>
    <p>
      In all cases you can then use the imported NAME directly, so for instance
      if you want the area of a circle:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from math import tau

radius = 3
area = tau * radius ** 2 / 2</code></pre>

      is to remove the need to have many references to a MODULE peppered
      throughout your code, but it’s best reserved for when the MODULE has many
      NAMEs that it exports and you want to just use one or two.<a

      or simply “all so”, which makes it a reduced form of

      >. The usage here comes from the adverb form meaning “[to act] in the
      manner or role [of some other thing]“. In Python it very specifically
      means “[from here on refer to this thing]
      <em><strong>as</strong></em> [this instead]“.

      some MODULE or NAME but refer to it by some other name. This is useful if
      the original name is particularly long, would conflict with one already in
      use in your code, or could simply use some extra information in context.

      Now that you’ve got the basics down, you’re getting into more complicated
      territory. What happens if you find yourself reaching a point in the code
      where you’re in an obvious error state and you don’t want to continue?
      This is where the notion of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling"
        >exception handling</a
      >
      come into play. We’ll go into more detail on the standard Exceptions in
      later articles, but for now let’s just say that an EXCEPTION is a special
      type of VALUE that signifies a specific issue that has come up in your
      program. That issue <em>might</em> be an <em>error</em>, in which case you
      might want to crash out of the program, or it might be a signal that
      something <em>unusual</em> but expected has occurred. Either way you need
      to be able to emit those signals from your own code, as well as catch and
      react to such signals emitted by other code.

      >
      BLOCK, re-raises the EXCEPTION being handled by the BLOCK.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Middle English word with <em>many</em> meanings, but in this case it
      comes from the verb form meaning “to lift upright, build, or construct” or
      “to make higher”. The meaning in computing is more specifically from a
      newer sense of “to mention [a question, issue, or argument] for
      discussion”, as in “to <em><strong>raise</strong></em> attention [to an
      issue]“. In several other programming languages
      <em><strong>throw</strong></em> is used with similar meaning.
    </p>
    <p>The usage is <em>usually</em> going to be:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>raise EXCEPTION</code></pre>
    <p>Quite rarely you might see the <em>chained</em> form:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>raise EXCEPTION from OTHER_EXCEPTION</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which is used to indicate that the EXCEPTION being raised was
      <em>caused by</em> (or <em>came from</em>) some other EXCEPTION. This
      isn’t used often, but sometimes is useful when you attempt to handle an
      exception raised by other code but somehow cannot do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly <em>inside</em> an
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#except"
        ><code>except</code></a
      >
      BLOCK you can simply:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>raise</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which will re-raise whatever EXCEPTION is currently being handled inside
      that BLOCK.

    </p>
    <p>
      From the Latin <em><strong>assertus</strong></em
      >, with the general sense of “declared, protected, or claimed”. In
      programming it specifically means to specify that a condition must be met
      at a particular point in the code, and to error if it is not.

    <pre class="text"><code>assert EXPRESSION</code></pre>

        ><code>True</code></a
      >
      .
    </p>
    <p>An alternative form allows you to specify a message:</p>
    <pre

      A verb borrowed from the Middle French
      <em><strong>excepter</strong></em> and Latin
      <em><strong>exceptus</strong></em
      >; the original meaning is “to receive”, but the more general uses it to
      “exclude [something]” or “object to [something]“, as in “every fruit
      except apples”. The meaning in Python is a little vague, but can be
      thought of as “catch, capture, or trap [an exception]“. In fact in many
      other languages <em><strong>catch</strong></em> is used for the same
      purpose; Python’s <em><strong>except</strong></em> is the exception to
      that rule.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      From the Middle English <em><strong>fynaly</strong></em> meaning “at the
      end or conclusion” or just “lastly”. It implies the very last thing to do
      in a sequence, which is the meaning here as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exception handling is the first circumstance you’ve encountered in which
      one BLOCK <em>must</em> be followed by another, and the rules are somewhat
      more complicated than anything you’ve yet seen. For instance there are
      <em>two</em> different <em>minimal syntactically valid</em> forms of
      exception handler:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>try:
    BLOCK
finally:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      This form does not actually handle any EXCEPTION raised within BLOCK, it
      merely ensures that STATEMENT is run in all circumstances. Any EXCEPTION
      not handled will continue to “raise up” until it is either handled or
      crashes your program. This is useful for situations in which you want to
      do the same action (such as closing a file or database connection) whether
      or not there has been an error.
    </p>
    <p>The second form <em>does</em> handle an EXCEPTION:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>try:
    BLOCK
except:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong>: because this form will catch
      <em>any</em> EXCEPTION, including several that are used by Python to
      perform critical operations, you should, practically speaking,
      <strong>never</strong> use the above form. Instead use the
      <em>minimum safe</em> form:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>try:
    BLOCK
except EXCEPTION:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      This ensures that the exception handler <em>only</em> handles the
      EXCEPTION <em>type</em> specified. The
      <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy"
        >hierarchy of built-in exceptions</a
      >
      in Python is complex and touches on concepts we can’t cover in this
      article, but for now just know that <code>except Exception</code> is the
      <em>least</em> specific
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#except"
        ><code>except</code></a
      >
      statement you should ever use in production code.
    </p>
    <p>
      That minimum safe form, however, isn’t particularly useful, because the
      STATEMENT can’t actually know what EXCEPTION it’s handling. Most of the
      time you’ll see something like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>except EXCEPTION as NAME:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which uses
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#as"
        ><code>as</code></a
      >
      to provide an alias NAME that can be used to inspect the actual EXCEPTION
      that was raised. This can be very helpful for seeing precisely what went
      wrong, which will help you decide if you can ignore the problem or need to
      respond in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also specify multiple different types of EXCEPTION to catch, which
      can be helpful if you want to respond to any of those forms in the
      <em>same</em> way:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>except (EXCEPTION_A, EXCEPTION_B, EXCEPTION_C) as NAME:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      And if you want to respond to them each in a <em>different</em> way you
      can just stack
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#except"
        ><code>except</code></a
      >
      BLOCKS:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>except EXCEPTION_A as NAME:
    STATEMENT_A
except EXCEPTION_B as NAME:
    STATEMENT_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also optionally use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#else"
        ><code>else</code></a
      >
      with an exception handler, so long as at least one
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#except"
        ><code>except</code></a
      >
      statement is used, and as long as the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#else"
        ><code>else</code></a
      >
      is positioned <em>before</em> any
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#finally"
        ><code>finally</code></a
      >
      :
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>try:
    BLOCK_A
except EXCEPTION as NAME:
    BLOCK_B
else:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      However this is relatively rare, because the STATEMENT indented under
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#else"
        ><code>else</code></a
      >
      will <em>only</em> be executed when no EXCEPTION was raised inside the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#try"
        ><code>try</code></a
      >
      BLOCK <em>and</em> no
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#break"
        ><code>break</code></a

      ,
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#continue"
        ><code>continue</code></a
      >
      , or
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      statements were encountered within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you’ve seen exception handling has some fairly dense syntax compared to
      the rest of Python. A fully fleshed out exception handler in a program
      that does something fairly complex, like interacting with a database,
      might involve all these parts.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>try:
    [connect to database]
    [query the database]
except ConnectionError as error:
    [log the error]
else:
    [log success]
finally:
    [close the connection]</code></pre>
    <p>
      But, thankfully, it’s often not that complex, and you usually only have to
      deal with exception handling when something truly exceptional has
      happened.

      Now that you’ve got all the structures you need to write an arbitrarily
      complex program, with the ability to make decisions, loop, and handle
      errors, your biggest problem is going to be organizing those structures
      into re-usable units. For instance you don’t want to type out a complex
      exception handler for every single time you connect to and query a
      database, as that would quickly lead to an unmanageable amount of
      repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the key mantras of programming is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"
        >Don’t Repeat Yourself</a
      >
      (aka <strong>DRY</strong>); the less boilerplate, the better, and so you
      want to be able to create
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine">subroutines</a>, which
      are the most basic form of <em>code re-use</em>. In Python the most common
      form of subroutine is the <em>function</em>, which comes in two primary
      forms.
    </p>
    <p><strong>anonymous (unnamed) functions</strong></p>
    <p>
      A lot of people teaching (and learning) Python tend to skip over anonymous
      functions, or treat them as an advanced feature, but that’s really just
      because they’re poorly named. The “anonymous” part just means the function
      isn’t given a specific name at creation time. That might not sound like
      the easiest thing to re-use – and you’re right – but it’s useful to
      understand them before we head on to <em>named</em> functions because
      they’re fundamentally simpler and more constrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately the powers that be decided that anonymous functions, already
      saddled with a bad and confusing name, should <em>definitely</em> get a
      worse name in Python.<a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"

      >Used to define a CALLABLE
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function"
        >anonymous function</a
      >
      and its <em>signature</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 11th letter of the Classical Greek alphabet,
      <em><strong>λ</strong></em
      >; it has no general meaning in English. In Python it is used because
      anonymous functions are a fundamental unit of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"
        >Alonzo Church’s Lambda Calculus</a
      >, which provides much of the mathematical underpinnings of modern
      computation. As an honor, that’s nice; in reality
      <em><strong>lambda</strong></em> would be used more often if it had a more
      fun name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the name a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      is actually the conceptually simplest form of function in Python, because
      you can think of it as a just a way of creating a delayed-evaluation
      EXPRESSION that’s stated with a specific form:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>lambda : EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which evaluates to a CALLABLE that will evaluate the EXPRESSION that comes
      <em>after</em> the colon only when the CALLABLE is itself called. To call
      it you use the <em>call syntax</em> that is common to all Python
      CALLABLEs, however since the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      is itself an EXPRESSION you need to surround it with parentheses to do
      that.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>(lambda : EXPRESSION)()</code></pre>
    <p>
      And <em>voila</em>, everything you’ve just written will instantly be
      replaced by whatever the inner EXPRESSION evaluates to.
    </p>
    <p>Thus all three of these are entirely identical:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>x = (lambda : 2 + 2)()
x = 2 + 2
x = 4</code></pre>
    <p>
      But just delaying an EXPRESSION isn’t really the most useful tool. So the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      introduces the idea of a <em>function signature</em>: you can add a NAME
      to the left side of the colon and the thing that NAME refers to will able
      to be used inside the inner EXPRESSION when it evaluates. This name is
      known as a <em>parameter</em> of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      with a single parameter:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>lambda NAME: EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>And here’s one with two parameters:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>lambda NAME_A, NAME_B: EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>
      And when we want to use the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      we just call it, passing in a concrete VALUE for every parameter in the
      signature:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>(lambda NAME_A, NAME_B: EXPRESSION)(VALUE_A, VALUE_B)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which you can imagine can be useful if we want to calculate the area of a
      rectangle:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>lambda width, height: width * height</code></pre>
    <p>
      But, again, we’re going to end up writing that a lot if we don’t assign it
      to a NAME:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>area = lambda width, height: width * height
square = area(2, 2)
rectangle = area(3, 5)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Great! The <code>square</code> is now <code>4</code> and
      <code>rectangle</code> is <code>15</code>; we’ve got the basis of code
      re-use!
    </p>
    <p>
      But
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      is going to get pretty nasty when the EXPRESSION starts to get long. And
      beyond that there are some pretty significant limitations, since we
      actually <em>cannot</em> execute many kinds of STATEMENT within a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      , much less an arbitrary BLOCK. They have their place, but maybe there’s a
      better and more flexible way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we’ve just gone and assigned what is supposed to be an
      <em>anonymous</em> (which means “has no name”) function to a NAME, let’s
      look at how we should <em>usually</em> write functions in Python.
    </p>
    <p><strong>named functions</strong></p>
    <p>
      The <em>named</em> function builds on the ideas of the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      but take them to a <em>much</em> more flexible place, allowing you to
      re-use large chunks of code quite easily. They’re a little more subtle to
      master too, because they don’t evaluate exactly like an EXPRESSION. In
      fact by default they’ll always evaluate to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      unless you explicitly tell them to do otherwise.<a

      A contraction of the word <em><strong>define</strong></em

      <em><strong>deffinen</strong></em> from Old French and Latin roots. It’s a
      verb that means “to specify or fix [the meaning of a word or phrase]“. In
      Python it is used specifically to create a named subroutine. In other
      languages <em><strong>define</strong></em
      >, <em><strong>fn</strong></em
      >, <em><strong>fun</strong></em
      >, <em><strong>func</strong></em

    <p>
      Because

        ><code>def</code></a
      >
      can be used to create arbitrarily complex CALLABLEs, it’s going to require
      some explanation. Essentially it’s used to create a new NAME that refers
      to a CALLABLE. In fact, from now on let’s just use FUNCTION to mean
      exactly that:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def FUNCTION():
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      This defines a FUNCTION that can be called using <code>FUNCTION()</code>,
      which will then execute every STATEMENT inside the indented BLOCK. As you
      can see it’s conceptually equivalent to the “named”
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      form you saw earlier. Compare these two forms:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def FUNCTION(NAME_A, NAME_B): STATEMENT
FUNCTION = lambda NAME_A, NAME_B : STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      And you’ll see they’re <em>very</em> similar, except that the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#def"
        ><code>def</code></a
      >
      version can run an arbitrary number of STATEMENTs<a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#fn:3"
        >3</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      These STATEMENTs will be executed within the <em>local scope</em> of the
      function, meaning that <em>any</em> NAME assigned <em>inside</em> the
      function cannot be <em>directly</em> seen or accessed by any code
      <em>outside</em> the function. In this example there are no such names,
      but there will be as soon as we change the <em>signature</em> of the
      function:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def FUNCTION(NAME):
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      And just as with
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      we can have multiple parameters:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def FUNCTION(NAME_A, NAME_B):
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which let’s us build the <code>area</code> function we made before with a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#lambda"
        ><code>lambda</code></a
      >
      :
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def area(width, height):
    width * height

square = area(2, 2)
rectangle = area(3, 5)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Except, wait a minute … didn’t I say just above that
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#def"
        ><code>def</code></a

      functions evaluate to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      when called? Yep, right now both <code>square</code> and
      <code>rectangle</code> are assigned to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      . We’ve calculated two areas, but then discard them again as soon as the
      <em>local scope</em> of <code>area</code> is closed. Now, how the heck do
      we get the area <em>out</em> of <code>area</code>, anyway?

      computing it has two meanings:

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        The intransitive meaning is “to give back (or relinquish) control [to
        the calling procedure]“, as in “when the function exits it will
        <em><strong>return</strong></em> control”.
      </li>
      <li>
        The transitive meaning is “to pass [some data] back to the calling
        procedure”, as in “this function will
        <em><strong>return</strong></em> the current time”.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In Python both meanings are combined, since a function will always
      <em><strong>return</strong></em> both control <em>and</em> data to the
      caller.

        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      immediately ends the function and returns
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      to the caller:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>return</code></pre>
    <p>
      This form is relatively rarely used; as mentioned before a function
      <em>always</em> evaluates to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#none"
        ><code>None</code></a
      >
      by default; thus you can imagine that
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      is the implicit last line of <em>every</em> function.
    </p>
    <p>Because of that it is much more common to see:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>return EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which immediately evaluates the EXPRESSION and returns the resulting
      OBJECT back to the caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      to pass back more than one OBJECT:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>return EXPRESSION_A, EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      This evaluates each EXPRESSION in turn, ends the function, and returns a
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-tuple"
        ><strong>tuple</strong></a
      >
      (a type of fixed-length COLLECTION) containing one OBJECT for each
      EXPRESSION.
    </p>
    <p>
      This multiple form is also relatively rare, as it can be a bit of a
      surprise to the user of the code, and so requires a bit more effort in
      documentation, but it can be convenient for internal functions that you
      don’t intend to be used by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you’ll notice is that
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      <em>terminates</em> a function at the moment it’s evaluated. Anything
      below that point in the function essentially doesn’t exist (with one
      exception, the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#finally"
        ><code>finally</code></a
      >
      block inside an exception handler). So how would you handle situations in
      which you needed to give back data, but continue to work afterwards?
    </p>
    <p><strong>pause the function and give back a value</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a

      <a

      , see below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etymologically the oddest word in this list; derives from the Middle
      English <em><strong>yielden</strong></em> and the Old English
      <em><strong>gieldan</strong></em
      >, both of which mean “to pay”, and share their root with the Old Norse
      <em><strong>gjald</strong></em> and the German
      <em><strong>geld</strong></em
      >, both of which mean “money”. Today <em><strong>geld</strong></em> means
      an ancient form of compelled tax or ransom, but it also means “to
      castrate”. Historically the Dangeld was a tax raised on the English by
      their king. This tax was raised to pay waves of Danish Vikings to,
      presumably, not castrate the English (or, at the very least, their king).
      None of this is directly important here, but might explain a little of why
      the meaning in computing derives from both “to give way and relinquish
      control”, as in “<em><strong>yield</strong></em> to oncoming traffic”, and
      “to give back [a result or return on investment]” as in “the fund has a
      <em><strong>yield</strong></em> of 5% per year”. In both cases the
      implication is that the situation is not yet final, and is likely
      recurring: you <em><strong>yield</strong></em
      >, then you wait, then you <em><strong>yield</strong></em> again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python it helps to remember an allegory:
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      is Death, and comes exactly once, while
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      is Taxes, and may only end when Death arrives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      is similar to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a

    <pre class="text"><code>yield</code></pre>
    <pre class="text"><code>yield EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <pre class="text"><code>yield EXPRESSION_A, EXPRESSION_B</code></pre>
    <p>
      However <em>any</em> function that uses
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      actually returns a special kind of COLLECTION known as a GENERATOR when
      called. Unlike a normal COLLECTION a GENERATOR does not hold all of its
      items in memory simultaneously, but instead “generates” each item as
      required by running through the function until
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      is encountered and it gives forth an item. The GENERATOR pauses execution
      at that point, allowing the code using the GENERATOR to work with that
      item. When desired it can request the next item, at which point the
      GENERATOR continues running to the next
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      , and so on until there are no more
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      statements left to run or a
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      is encountered.
    </p>
    <p>This is what allows the next form:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>yield from GENERATOR</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which is a specialized use case that allows you to write a GENERATOR that
      will
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      every item, in turn, from <em>another</em> GENERATOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thorough explanation of GENERATORs is outside the scope of this series
      of articles, as they’re a fairly advanced topic. For now it’s sufficient
      to know that if you encounter
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a

      you’re looking at a GENERATOR.

      Three for Manipulating Namespaces
      <a id="three-for-manipulating-namespaces"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you understand the basics of function, you’ll need to know about
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace">namespaces</a>, as they
      become very important when you start building more complex programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its simplest a namespace is essentially just the place where Python
      stores any NAME you create, so they’re used whenever Python needs to look
      up the OBJECT referred to by that NAME. Each namespace has a
      <em>scope</em>, which limits how long the namespace “lives” and whether or
      not any NAME within it is <em>readable</em> and/or <em>writable</em> by a
      given STATEMENT. Namespaces form a hierarchy, however, so the rules can be
      a bit tricky to remember.
    </p>
    <p>In any given namespace a STATEMENT can:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        both <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> any NAME defined in its own
        namespace
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>read</em>, but not <em>write</em>, any NAME defined in an enclosing
        <em>parent</em> namespace
      </li>
      <li>
        neither <em>read</em> nor <em>write</em> any NAME defined in a
        <em>sibling</em> or <em>child</em> namespace
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      At the top level is Python’s own namespace, which contains all the
      <em>builtin</em> NAMEs that Python provides for you. This namespace
      <em>cannot</em> be written to, and any NAME in it essentially lives
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes the <em>global</em> namespace, which is the namespace of the
      MODULE you’re working in; it becomes the parent of all other namespaces
      created within that MODULE. Any NAME defined here <em>usually</em> lives
      for the duration your program is running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, each CALLABLE you create gets its own unique
      <em>local</em> namespace <em>when it is called</em>; any NAME created here
      lives only as long as the CALLABLE is running, and when it finishes both
      the NAME and the OBJECT it refers to will be destroyed, unless either
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      or
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      is used to pass it back to the calling scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since you can define a CALLABLE that is nested <em>inside</em> another
      CALLABLE you can build a namespace hierarchy of arbitrary depth, so any
      given NAME might exist in any number of namespaces further and further
      removed from where you’re actually trying to use that NAME. This can get
      unwieldy to think about pretty quick, though, which is why we
      <em>try</em> to limit the amount of nesting we do in practical code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assignment of a new NAME is pretty straightforward: unless modified by
      one of the keywords below a NAME is <em>always</em> assigned in the scope
      in which the assignment STATEMENT occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the <em>use</em> of a NAME is a little less obvious: when used in a
      STATEMENT Python first searches for the NAME in the immediate
      <em>local</em> scope. If it cannot find the NAME then it searches the
      immediate parent (known as the <em>nonlocal</em>) scope, and then it keeps
      searching each successive parent scope until it either finds the NAME or
      cannot resolve it and errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this usually somewhat invisible machinery exists to allow you to
      write code using NAMEs that are appropriate and clear to the scope in
      which you’re working. So long as it isn’t a keyword and you don’t
      <em>need</em> to use the NAME from an ancestor’s scope you can use
      whatever NAME you want locally and not worry about it overwriting anything
      <em>outside</em> its own scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Most</em> of the time you don’t want to fool around with that
      machinery, but every so often there’s a good reason to. Or a bad one
      that’s gotten you confused.
    </p>
    <p><strong>write to the top from anywhere</strong></p>
    <p>
      In <em>extremely rare</em> circumstances you want to directly manipulate
      the <em>global</em> namespace in a way you wouldn’t normally be allowed.<a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#global"
        >global</a

        >docs</a
      >Used to declare a NAME as part of the <em>global</em> namespace; the NAME
      <em>cannot</em> have been used previously in the same namespace. In effect
      this allows a <em>local</em> STATEMENT to both create and assign to a
      <em>global</em> NAME it otherwise could only read. <em>Can</em> be used
      within the global namespace, but has no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      An adjective borrowed from the French, with the general meaning of
      “worldwide” and “universal”. In computing the meaning is specifically “[a
      NAME that is] accessible by all parts of a program”. In Python it is both
      the top-most <em>namespace</em>, which is <em>readable</em> from within
      all functions and methods, but is also a keyword that binds a
      <em>local</em> NAME into the <em><strong>global</strong></em> namespace,
      allowing it to be <em>writable</em> from within that
      <em>local</em> namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage is quite simple; the main restriction is that it cannot appear
      <em>after</em> the NAME has been used:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>global NAME
NAME = EXPRESSION</code></pre>
    <p>
      You should be aware that the use of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#global"
        ><code>global</code></a
      >
      is an <em>immediate</em>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smell</a>, as its
      use is <em>almost always</em> an indication of bad coding habits, because
      it <em>usually</em> can – and almost certainly <em>should</em> – be
      replaced with <em>argument passing</em> and <em>return values</em>. There
      are data structures and dynamic code generation tasks that would be
      impossible to build without it, but the <em>odds</em> are if you’re
      thinking about using it, <strong>don’t</strong>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>write to the parent from the child</strong></p>
    <p>
      Slightly more often there’s a need for the child to tell the parent what
      to do.<a

      >Used exclusively inside <em>nested</em> functions / methods (also known
      as <em>closures</em>) to bind a <em>pre-existing</em> NAME in the

      any reference to that NAME in the local scope.

    <p>
      An adjective formed by combining the prefix
      <em><strong>non-</strong></em> (“not”) and
      <em><strong>local</strong></em> (“pertaining to a particular place”). This
      is a primarily scientific and technical <em>neologism</em> (literally “new
      word”) that has no true general meaning, only specific meanings within
      specific fields. In programming it signifies a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-local_variable"
        >non-local variable</a
      >, meaning “[a NAME that is] accessible in neither the <em>local</em> nor
      the <em>global</em> namespace”. In Python it very specifically applies to
      the namespace of the enclosing function from the point of view of a nested
      function, and is also a keyword that binds a <em>local</em> NAME within
      that nested function into the
      <em><strong>nonlocal</strong></em> namespace, allowing it to be
      <em>writable</em> from within the nested function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it is <em>only</em> of use inside a nested function, usage will
      always involve some enclosing structure:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>def OUTER_FUNCTION():
    NAME = VALUE
    def INNER_FUNCTION():
        nonlocal NAME
        NAME = EXPRESSION
    INNER_FUNCTION()</code></pre>
    <p>
      The key thing to understand is that
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#nonlocal"
        ><code>nonlocal</code></a
      >
      is used in a <em>similar</em> fashion to
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#global"
        ><code>global</code></a
      >
      , but with the more limited goal of making a variable in the parent of a
      nested function writable. It has similar caveats as well, though the fact
      that its impact isn’t felt by the <em>entire</em> program makes it
      inherently less dangerous. Still, its uses are <em>very</em> narrow and
      <em>relatively</em> few, so try not to abuse it when argument passing will
      do.
    </p>
    <p><strong>kill it with fire</strong></p>
    <p>
      So far you’ve seen how to <em>add</em> a NAME to a namespace, but how do
      you <em>remove</em> a NAME from a namespace?<a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#del"
        >del</a
      ><a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-del-statement"
        >docs</a
      >Used to delete a NAME (or NAMEs) from a namespace; if no other references
      exist to the OBJECT that NAME referred to, the underlying OBJECT is
      deleted as well.Can also be used to delete an attribute of an OBJECT or a
      member (or members) of a COLLECTION <em>if</em> the specific type has
      allowed this operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A contraction of <em><strong>delete</strong></em
      >, which is in turn a verb derived from the Latin
      <em><strong>deletus</strong></em
      >. Its general meaning is to “destroy or eradicate”, “erase or smudge
      out”, and “utterly remove”, and while the specific meaning in computing is
      a little less violent it has similar effect. In Python the meaning is a
      little indirect: <em><strong>del</strong></em> is used to delete a
      <em>reference</em> that the <em>user</em> directly controls, which
      <em>may</em> indirectly trigger deletion of the thing referred to from
      process memory, which the <em>interpreter</em> controls.
    </p>
    <p>The most common usage is to provide a single NAME:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>del NAME</code></pre>
    <p>However it is also valid to provide multiple NAMEs, comma separated:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>del NAME_A, NAME_B, NAME_C</code></pre>
    <p>
      In either case Python will proceed left to right, deleting each NAME from
      the namespace in which the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#del"
        ><code>del</code></a
      >
      invocation has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the effect is limited to the <em>closest</em> namespace, you have
      to use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#global"
        ><code>global</code></a
      >
      or

        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#nonlocal"
        ><code>nonlocal</code></a
      >
      to delete a NAME outside the local namespace:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>global NAME
del NAME</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#del"
        ><code>del</code></a
      >
      to delete attributes of OBJECTs and member(s) of COLLECTIONs, however what
      actually happens depends on the type of the OBJECT / COLLECTION involved.
      The <strong>list</strong> COLLECTION, for instance, allows you to use
      <a

        ><code>del</code></a

      We’ll leave a further exploration of this for when we discuss the
      <em>builtin</em> types in later articles. In the meantime, let’s finally
      meet the keyword that will let you start defining such type-specific
      behaviors for yourself.

      One for Defining New Types of Object
      <a id="one-for-defining-new-types-of-object"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Up until this point I’ve been pretty vague about what an OBJECT actually
      is. In the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29"
        >Object-Oriented Programming</a
      >
      paradigm, also known as OOP, an object is, basically, a
      <em>thing</em> that has both <em>state</em> (in the form of named
      <em>attributes</em>) and <em>behavior</em> (in the form of callable
      <em>methods</em>). Two individual things of the same <em>type</em> may
      have different specific values for those attributes – we call them
      different <em>instances</em> of the same <em>type</em> – but they share
      the same overall <em>interface</em>. However there’s a bit more to it than
      that; the programmer should be able to define partial interfaces, which
      we’ll call <em>traits</em>, that types with similar needs can implement in
      different ways, such that they all share some common attributes and
      behaviors (a property known as
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29"
        ><em>polymorphism</em></a
      >). Additionally these traits should be able to be passed from more
      generic types to more specific types via an
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29"
        >inheritance</a
      >
      mechanism, much as a parent passes on traits to their children.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can take an example from nature; a duck is a type of bird, and it
      inherits certain traits it shares will all birds. All birds are a type of
      animal, and thus inherit certain traits shared will all animals. An animal
      is a type of life, and so on. Thus Howard, a specific duck, has all the
      attributes and behaviors of life, animals, birds, and ducks, all rolled up
      nicely in one instance of the duck type.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact it is from just such an example of biological
      <em>classification</em> that Python takes the keyword it uses for defining
      new types of OBJECT.<a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        >class</a

        >docs</a
      >Used to define a template for a new type of OBJECT.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noun borrowed via the French <em><strong>classe</strong></em> from the
      Latin <em><strong>classis</strong></em
      >, which meant “a division, army, fleet”, “the people of Rome under arms”,
      and, oddly specifically, “any one of the six orders into which Servius
      Tullius divided the Roman people for the purpose of taxation”, which goes
      a long way towards explaining why English is such a difficult language to
      master. The general meaning we use here, though, is loosely borrowed from
      evolutionary taxonomy, implying “a group that shares certain inheritable
      traits”. The specific meaning in Python comes from Object-Oriented
      Programming and implies “a template for creating objects that share common
      inheritable state (attributes) and behavior (methods)”.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Python you define a new type by creating a new NAME that is also a
      CALLABLE; from now on we’ll call that a CLASS. The
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        ><code>class</code></a
      >
      keyword is used to start a new BLOCK that defines the
      <em>implementation</em> of that CLASS:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class CLASS:
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>The CLASS can now be called to create a new instance of its type:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>NAME = CLASS()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now from the above you might expect that instance to have
      <em>no</em> attributes or behavior, but in fact it does have the
      <em>minimal</em> interface that all OBJECTs share (it can be printed and
      used in comparisons, for instance, though not very usefully). It receives
      this because <em>all</em> new
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        ><code>class</code></a
      >
      definitions implicitly inherit from
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object"
        ><strong>object</strong></a
      >, which is Python’s <em>base type</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also specify a more generic CLASS (also known as a
      <em>superclass</em>) to inherit from:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class CLASS(SUPERCLASS):
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>
      In fact you’ll often want to inherit from more than one superclass in
      order to mix together their various traits. This is done by separating the
      superclasses with commas:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class CLASS(SUPERCLASS_A, SUPERCLASS_B):
    pass</code></pre>
    <p>
      The notion of
      <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/classes.html#multiple-inheritance"
        >multiple inheritance</a
      >
      can get quite complicated when more than one superclass defines the same
      attribute or method NAMEs, so for now let’s just keep our classes simple
      and assume no such overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just defining the CLASS and its superclasses without giving it some
      attributes and methods of its own is unusual, so you’ll
      <em>normally</em> see at minimum a custom <em>initializer</em> method,
      which by convention is done by defining the special
      <em>double underscore</em> (or “dunder”) <em>instance method</em>
      <strong>__init__</strong>:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>class CLASS:
    def __init__(self, NAME):
        self.NAME = NAME</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see an instance method is just another kind of function
      definition made using
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#def"
        ><code>def</code></a
      >
      . In fact a METHOD is just a FUNCTION that’s been added to the CLASS’s
      namespace. That’s right, the
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        ><code>class</code></a
      >
      keyword also creates a new kind of local namespace, this one remains
      attached to the CLASS and allows names to be looked up on either the
      <em>instance</em> or the class itself using the
      <em>dot access</em> patterns INSTANCE.NAME and CLASS.NAME. Notice the
      <strong>self</strong> parameter name in the method definition above?
      That’s the name given by convention to the <em>first</em> parameter of any
      instance method, and it’s how you access attributes set on the instance
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all sounds a little abstract, so let’s demonstrate it by building a
      CLASS for thinking about circles.
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>from math import tau

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def diameter(self):
        return self.radius * 2

    def circumference(self):
        return self.radius * tau

    def area(self):
        return tau * self.radius ** 2 / 2</code></pre>
    <p>Now if we create an instance representing the <em>unit circle</em>:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>unit = Circle(1)</code></pre>
    <p>
      We can access and
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print"
        ><strong>print</strong></a
      >
      the <strong>self.radius</strong> attribute:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>print(unit.radius)</code></pre>
    <p>
      And we can also call any of its methods, but notice how we never have to
      pass the radius of the circle as an argument, since the methods can all
      access that via <strong>self</strong>:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>print(unit.diameter())
print(unit.circumference())
print(unit.area())</code></pre>
    <p>
      Since they’re the fundamental building block of <em>everything</em> in
      Python’s
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">data model</a
      >, there’s a <em>lot</em> than can be said
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/classes.html#classes"
        >about classes in Python</a
      >, and there’s a lot of subtleties that can go into their proper use (and
      improper abuse), so we’ll come back to them often in later articles in
      this series. For now though the important thing is to start to recognize
      how
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        ><code>class</code></a
      >
      is used to create them, and how instances are used when accessing their
      attributes and methods. It’s also helpful to know that there are quite a
      few “dunder” methods, and that these are used to implement a lot of the
      common “under-the-hood” functionality that supports all the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html"
        >builtin functions</a
      >
      we’ll start to meet in later articles.

      One for Working Within a Context

    </h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes there are actions you <em>always</em> want to perform within a
      specific context, such as committing a database transaction or closing a
      network connection. These sort of things <em>usually</em> involve some
      form of <em>exception handling</em> or other boilerplate specific to the
      task, and that can lead to a lot of boilerplate that needs to be repeated.
      An example is something as simple as reading a file: opening the file must
      necessarily mean getting some resources from the underlying operating
      system, and you always want to free up those resources, even if you
      accidentally tried to open a file that didn’t exist or which you did not
      have permissions to read. The file is a <em>type</em> of OBJECT that will
      always carry that contextual need to manage a resource with it, and so
      you’ll need to write the same
      <a

      boilerplate <em>every</em> time you open a file.

      A Middle English preposition that takes its pronunciation from one Old
      English term, <em><strong>wið</strong></em> (“against”), but takes its
      modern meaning from another, <em><strong>mid</strong></em> (“in
      association with”) which in turn comes from the German
      <em><strong>mit</strong></em
      >. The meaning in Python derives from <em><strong>within</strong></em
      >, meaning “inside the scope or context of [some thing or event]“.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any use of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#with"
        ><code>with</code></a
      >
      requires an EXPRESSION that evaluates to an OBJECT that satisfies the
      <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#context-manager-types"
        >context manager type</a
      >’s interface, and thus has implemented both the
      <strong>__enter__</strong> and <strong>__exit__</strong> “dunder” methods.
      From now on we’ll call that EXPRESSION a CONTEXT_MANAGER, to make the
      examples clearer.
    </p>
    <p>In the most basic usage you simply start a new BLOCK:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>with CONTEXT_MANAGER:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which will enter the context by calling
      <code>CONTEXT_MANAGER.__enter__()</code>, execute the STATEMENT within the
      context, and then exit the context by calling
      <code>CONTEXT_MANAGER.__exit__()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most often you’ll want to use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#as"
        ><code>as</code></a
      >
      to assign the OBJECT returned by
      <code>CONTEXT_MANAGER.__enter__()</code> to an alias NAME so the BLOCK can
      work with it:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>with CONTEXT_MANAGER as NAME:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      This can save you a lot of boilerplate, especially with the many standard
      OBJECTs that already implement the context manager interface. For instance
      the recommended way to read a file’s contents:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>with open(path) as src:
    contents = src.read()</code></pre>
    <p>Is <em>much</em> simpler than what you’d otherwise have to write:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>src = open(path)
try:
    contents = src.read()
finally:
    src.close()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Occasionally you’ll want to work within more than one CONTEXT_MANAGER:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="text"
    ><code>with CONTEXT_MANAGER_A as NAME_A, CONTEXT_MANAGER_B as NAME_B:
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which works exactly the same as nesting one
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#with"
        ><code>with</code></a
      >
      inside another:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>with CONTEXT_MANAGER_A as NAME_A:
    with CONTEXT_MANAGER_B as NAME_B:
        STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      You’ll get to meet quite a few context managers as you work your way
      through the Python standard library. And now you know that building your
      own is just a matter of creating a new
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#class"
        ><code>class</code></a
      >
      and implementing a couple of “dunder” methods.

    <p>
      Any function or method you write with
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#def"
        ><code>def</code></a
      >
      alone is, by definition, <em>synchronous</em>, meaning that the moment you
      call it your running code has to stop everything else and <em>wait</em>,
      however long it takes, for your function to either
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a

      control back to it before the rest of your code can be executed. For most
      tasks that happen on a local machine this is sensible and perfectly fine,
      especially when you <em>need</em> the answer before you can proceed any
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      In much modern programming though it’s often necessary to interact with
      things that <em>don’t</em> respond quickly, like network interactions with
      servers that could be a world away, and sometimes there’s
      <em>plenty</em> of work you could be doing while you wait for them to
      respond. You still <em>need</em> the answer, but you need it
      <em>eventually</em>. One way this can be addressed is via
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_%28computer_programming%29"
        >asynchronous programming</a
      >, which as of Python 3.5 has become a first-class part of the Python
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asynchronous programming is an advanced topic that is fairly specialized,
      so using it is well outside the scope of this series. It’s also quite a
      new addition to the language, and its usage has fluctuated from version to
      version. Rather than try to summarize those changed I’ll just describe the
      very basics of using these keywords in Python 3.7 below. If, however,
      you’re curious there’s a
      <a href="https://realpython.com/async-io-python/"
        >quite good async primer available here</a
      >
      that seems to be kept up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because asynchronous code does the same work as synchronous code, but
      <em>schedules</em> the execution of that work differently, only two new
      keywords needed to be added to the language.<a

      As you may have guessed, this is a contraction of the Modern English word
      <em><strong>asynchronous</strong></em
      >, which is formed by combining the Latin roots
      <em><strong>a-</strong></em> (“not”) and
      <em><strong>syn-</strong></em> (“together”) with
      <em><strong>Khronus</strong></em
      >, the Ancient Greek personification of <em>time</em>. It unambiguously
      means “not occurring at the same time”. In Python it more specifically
      marks an operation as “not occurring in the same time as the caller”,
      which allows the caller to wait for the result of that operation, which
      will occur at <em>some</em> point in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the meaning of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async</code></a
      >
      is tied to the KEYWORD it marks, its usage is always the same:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>async KEYWORD</code></pre>
    <p>
      However, unlike other any other keyword we’ve seen, the usage of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async</code></a
      >
      will <em>always</em> begin with the definition of a new COROUTINE:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>async def COROUTINE():
    STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Both of the other forms of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async</code></a
      >
      exist to allow you to work <em>within</em> a COROUTINE with
      <em>other</em> COROUTINEs, and thus they can only exist <em>inside</em> an
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async def</code></a
      >
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance you can use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async for</code></a

      to loop over an

        href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-iterators"
        >asynchronous iterator</a
      >
      such as a GENERATOR COROUTINE (which is simply a COROUTINE that uses
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#yield"
        ><code>yield</code></a
      >
      instead of
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#return"
        ><code>return</code></a
      >
      ).
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>async def COROUTINE():
    async for item in GENERATOR_COROUTINE:
        STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also use
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async with</code></a
      >
      to perform work within the context of an
      <a
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#asynchronous-context-managers"
        >asynchronous context manager</a
      >:
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>async def COROUTINE():
    async with CONTEXT_MANAGER_COROUTINE as NAME:
        STATEMENT</code></pre>
    <p>
      Virtually every COROUTINE will need to wait on other COROUTINE(s), which
      is why there’s another keyword that can only be used within an
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"

      From the Middle English verb <em><strong>awaiten</strong></em> (“to wait
      for”) from the Old French <em><strong>awaitier</strong></em
      >/<em><strong>agaitier</strong></em> (“to lie in wait for, watch, or
      observe”). The general sense is more active and hostile than
      <em><strong>wait</strong></em

      “[suspend execution] and wait [for something to finish]“.

      keyword is always going to be used to call a COROUTINE inside an
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#async"
        ><code>async def</code></a

      :
    </p>
    <pre class="text"><code>async def OUTER_COROUTINE():
    await COROUTINE()</code></pre>
    <p>
      Which will pause the execution of the outer COROUTINE and wait until the
      called COROUTINE, eventually, returns control. Any VALUE returned by the
      called COROUTINE is passed through
      <a
        href="https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/the-35-words-you-need-to-python/#await"
        ><code>await</code></a
      >
      , so you can think of <code>await COROUTINE()</code> as an asynchronous
      EXPRESSION that will, <em>eventually</em> evaluate to whatever the
      COROUTINE returns when called.

      Of course now that you’ve got the basics of doing asynchronous work down,
      how do you actually <em>perform</em> such work? Well, as of Python 3.7
      that still requires using functionality provided by the
      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a>
      module, the details of which are <em>well</em> outside the scope of these
      articles. See the
      <a href="https://realpython.com/async-io-python/">async primer</a> I
      mentioned earlier for details.

      There you have them, Python’s 35 keywords: in and of themselves not enough
      to make you fluent in Python, but if you’ve read this far and digested it
      you’re well on your way to truly <em>understanding</em> (and not merely
      <em>using</em>) the skeleton of <em>what is going on</em> in one of the
      fastest growing general programming languages around. In the next post in
      this series we’ll take a step away from <em>words</em> and look instead at
      <em>symbols</em>, with a dive into Python’s slightly smaller, but
      thankfully <em>much</em> simpler, list of <em>operators</em>.

        There are 35 keywords as of Python 3.7, the current major version of the
        language as of the time of writing. New Python keywords are added quite
        rarely, and it’s even more rare for keywords to be removed, but in
        whatever version you’re on you can use
        <code>from keyword import kwlist; print(kwlist)</code> to view the
        current list.
