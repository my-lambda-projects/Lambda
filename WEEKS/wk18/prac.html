          Level description Level Description Level 1 Beginner means someone who
          has just gone through an introductory Python course. He can solve some
          problems with 1 or 2 Python classes or functions. Normally, the
          answers could directly be found in the textbooks. Level 2 Intermediate
          means someone who has just learned Python, but already has a
          relatively strong programming background from before. He should be
          able to solve problems which may involve 3 or 3 Python classes or
          functions. The answers cannot be directly be found in the textbooks.
          Level 3 Advanced. He should use Python to solve more complex problem
          using more rich libraries functions and data structures and
          algorithms. He is supposed to solve the problem using several Python
          standard packages and advanced techniques.

    <p>Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:</p>
    <p>abcdefgabc</p>
    <p>Then, the output of the program should be:</p>
    <p>a,2 c,2 b,2 e,1 d,1 g,1 f,1</p>
    <p>
      Hints: Use dict to store key/value pairs. Use dict.get() method to lookup
      a key with default value.
    </p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>
      dic = {} s=raw_input() for s in s: dic[s] = dic.get(s,0)+1 print
      ‘’.join([‘%s,%s’ % (k, v) for k, v in dic.items()])

    <p>Question:</p>
    <p>
      Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print it in
      reverse order.
    </p>
    <p>Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:</p>
    <p>rise to vote sir</p>
    <p>Then, the output of the program should be:</p>
    <p>ris etov ot esir</p>
    <p>Hints: Use list[::-1] to iterate a list in a reverse order.</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>s=raw_input() s = s[::-1] print s</p>

    <p>Question:</p>
    <p>
      Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the
      characters that have even indexes.
    </p>
    <p>Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:</p>
    <p>H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d</p>
    <p>Then, the output of the program should be:</p>
    <p>Helloworld</p>
    <p>Hints: Use list[::2] to iterate a list by step 2.</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>s=raw_input() s = s[::2] print s #—————————————-#</p>
    <p>Question:</p>
    <p>Please write a program which prints all permutations of [1,2,3]</p>
    <p>Hints: Use itertools.permutations() to get permutations of list.</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>import itertools print list(itertools.permutations([1,2,3]))</p>
    <p>#—————————————-# Question:</p>
    <p>
      Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: We count 35
      heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many
      rabbits and how many chickens do we have?
    </p>
    <p>Hint: Use for loop to iterate all possible solutions.</p>
    <p>Solution:</p>
    <p>
      def solve(numheads,numlegs): ns=‘No solutions!’ for i in
      range(numheads+1): j=numheads-i if 2<em>i+4</em>j==numlegs: return i,j
      return ns,ns
    </p>
    <p>
      numheads=35 numlegs=94 solutions=solve(numheads,numlegs) print solutions
    </p>
