/*MAKE SURE TO RETURN ALL OF THE ANSWERS ON THESE TASKS, IF YOU DON'T, THE AUTOGRADER WILL NOT WORK*/

/*
When doing these tasks, we recommend using console.log to test the output of your code to make sure it works correctly.
This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

/*
Task 1b - Values

Do the following:   
   1. Declare two variables and assign them values
   2. Use a conditional to change the value of the 1st variable based on the value assigned to the 2nd variable
   3. Console log the new value of the 1st variable

Do the following:
   1. Invoke the dogYears function below and pass an age value to it
   2. Use the received value to calculate the age in dog years (1 human year is equal to 7 dog years)

//Dog feeder - Depending on their weight and age, we need to know how many pounds of food to feed our dog each day!
/*
Use the hungryDog function and feeding requirements below to do the following:
  1. Invoke the hungryDog function below and pass it a weight value in pounds
  2. Also, pass to hungryDog an age value in years (note: if the dog is a puppy, the age will be a decimal. For example: three months = 3/12 or .25)
  3. Do the proper calculations and return the number of pounds of raw food to feed the dog/puppy in a day
  
  REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights
  
  Feeding Requirements:

  Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
     up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight
     6 - 10 lbs - 4% of their body weight 
     11 - 15 lbs - 3% of their body weight 
     > 15lbs - 2% of their body weight 

  Puppies less than 1 year
     2 - 4 months 10% of their body weight
     4 - 7 months 5% of their body weight 
     7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
    
  NOTE: If done correctly, a weight of 15 lbs and age of 1 year would return 0.44999999999999996

// Rock, Paper, Scissors - Let's play against the computer!
/*
Create a global variable that randomly generates the computer's choice
Use Math.random to determine the computers choice (Math.random gives a random number between 0 and 1)

HINT: While you can complete this with only conditionals based on strings, it may help to equate choice to a number when using Math.random()

Use the game function below to do the following:
  1. Receive 2 parameters the user's choice and the computer's choice
  2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below - the strings returned need to match the strings below exactly.
   - win should return "you win!"
   - lose should return "you lose!"
   - tie should return "it's a tie"
  
  RULES OF THE GAME: Scissors beats Paper | Paper beats Rock | Rock beats Scissors | Or there's a tie
  
  HINT: Remember that the order in which we pass in our arguments matters when it comes to parameters
