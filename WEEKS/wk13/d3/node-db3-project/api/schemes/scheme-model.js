}

function findById(scheme_id) { // EXERCISE B
  /*
    1B- Study the SQL query below running it in SQLite Studio against `data/schemes.db3`:

      SELECT
          sc.scheme_name,
          st.*
      FROM schemes as sc
      LEFT JOIN steps as st
          ON sc.scheme_id = st.scheme_id
      WHERE sc.scheme_id = 1
      ORDER BY st.step_number ASC;

    2B- When you have a grasp on the query go ahead and build it in Knex
    making it parametric: instead of a literal `1` you should use `scheme_id`.

    3B- Test in Postman and see that the resulting data does not look like a scheme,
    but more like an array of steps each including scheme information:

      [
        {
          "scheme_id": 1,
          "scheme_name": "World Domination",
          "step_id": 2,
          "step_number": 1,
          "instructions": "solve prime number theory"
        },
        {
          "scheme_id": 1,
          "scheme_name": "World Domination",
          "step_id": 1,
          "step_number": 2,
          "instructions": "crack cyber security"
        },
        // etc
      ]

    4B- Using the array obtained and vanilla JavaScript, create an object with
    the structure below, for the case _when steps exist_ for a given `scheme_id`:

      {
        "scheme_id": 1,
        "scheme_name": "World Domination",
        "steps": [
          {
            "step_id": 2,
            "step_number": 1,
            "instructions": "solve prime number theory"
          },
          {
            "step_id": 1,
            "step_number": 2,
            "instructions": "crack cyber security"
          },
          // etc
        ]
      }

    5B- This is what the result should look like _if there are no steps_ for a `scheme_id`:

      {
        "scheme_id": 7,
        "scheme_name": "Have Fun!",
        "steps": []
      }
  */
}

          "instructions": "collect all the sheep in Scotland",
          "scheme_name": "Get Rich Quick"

        {
          "step_id": 4,
          "step_number": 2,
          "instructions": "profit",
          "scheme_name": "Get Rich Quick"
        }
