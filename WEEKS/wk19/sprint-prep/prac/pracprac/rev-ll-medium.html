    <p>
      A common interview question asked at larger companies, reversing a linked
      list is a problem I’ve seen trip up a lot of engineers throughout my time
      at <a href="https://www.outco.io/">Outco</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often being unable to solve this problem stems from an engineer not being
      familiar with what linked lists are ahead of time, or not understanding
      the difference between a linked list and an array.
    </p>
    <p>
      This post assumes that you know what a linked list is, and some of its
      basic properties. If you don’t, here’s a good primer on Geeks for Geeks:
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two common erroneous approaches I see that on the surface seem
      to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is to start from the head and the tail, and swap the elements in
      the list, as if you were operating on an array. This would be done with
      two pointers, and after a swap the front pointer would move up and the
      rear pointer would move back. This would continue until the two pointers
      meet in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>The problem with this is if your ListNode class looks like this:</p>
    <p>
      class ListNode { constructor(value) { this.value = value;<br />
      this.next = null; }<br />
      }let node1 = new ListNode(1);/* How node1 looks on the inside:{<br />
      value: 1<br />
      next: null<br />
      }*/
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you only have a single reference to the next node in the list, but no
      reference to the previous node. This means there’s no way for the pointer
      at the end to move backwards through the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second approach is to dump the contents of a linked list into some
      other data structure, like an array, and then create a new linked list,
      starting from the back of the array, or by first reversing that array.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like a reasonable approach, and works well when the data we’re
      working with in the nodes is small, or we don’t have a large number of
      nodes. Like in this example, where our nodes are only holding integers as
      their values, and we only have 3 nodes.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        -&gt; (2) -&gt; (3) ==&gt; [1, 2, 3] ==&gt; [3, 2, 1]==&gt; (3) -&gt;
        (2) -&gt; (1)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      But the problem with doing this is that it eats up a lot of unnecessary
      space. What if instead of integers, we were holding much more complex
      data? Or what if we had A LOT of nodes and we can’t just replicate all
      their contents because we just don’t have the RAM or disk space?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the real world you most likely won’t have to implement this exact
      function. But it is good to think about why duplicating data isn’t the
      most efficient approach. Dumping all the contents into the array, even if
      you’re not duplicating them, and are just referencing them, still takes up
      <code>O(N)</code> space.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the prompt might say to modify the original linked list, or that you
      are only allowed to use <code>O(1)</code> space complexity. At which
      point, this solution falls apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I want to demonstrate with this post, is a simple way of reversing a
      list, with just 3 pointers. This runs in <code>O(N)</code> time and
      <code>O(1)</code> space.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s start by talking about what reversing actually means.</p>
    <p>
      In a singly linked list, order is determined by a given node’s
      <code>next</code> property. This property can either reference another
      node or will point to <code>null</code> if this is the last node in the
      list. So reversing a linked list, simply means reassigning all the
      <code>next</code> properties, on every node.
    </p>
    <p>So we are really just going from this:</p>
    <p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>To this:</p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SircT6-WtggLRZ5RSQCPDw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>Let’s look at what happens on an individual node level:</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*LevCgUHbn0T0FpVdTvN9Mg.png?q=20"

    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*LevCgUHbn0T0FpVdTvN9Mg.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      To do a reassignment on a single node (in this example it will be the 2
      node) we just need two variables, let’s call them <code>previous</code> ,
      <code>current</code> . And all we’re doing is taking
      <code>current.next</code> (which is represented by the arrow) and setting
      it equal to <code>previous</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*PxlvqAro7JCBXPXfAWBBmg.png?q=20"
      />
    </p>
    <p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we’ve lost our reference to the node the <code>current</code> was
      originally pointing to. So to make sure we don’t lose track of that node,
      we need a third variable: <code>following</code> . This has to be set
      BEFORE we do the reassignment.
    </p>
    <p>

      />
    </p>
    <p>
      This lays out the basic mechanics of pointer reassignment, now let’s start
      to look at how this works on the list as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we need to repeat this process throughout the entire list if we
      want to fully reverse it. We can do this by moving each of those variables
      up through the list, from front to back, after each reassignment. We just
      have to be careful in our order of operations.
    </p>
    <p>There are four tricky pieces to all this:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Knowing what to assign the variables to initially.</li>
      <li>Knowing when to end this process of reassignments.</li>
      <li>
        Making sure the order of operations is correct so we don’t lose track of
        any nodes.
      </li>
      <li>Returning the correct value.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Let’s start with the first point. Initially, we want both the
      <code>current</code> and the <code>following</code> equal to the
      <code>head</code> that is given as the input.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because we can’t assume the length of the linked list. What if
      <code>head</code> was <code>null</code> and we’re looking at an empty
      list?
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head}
    </p>
    <p>
      If we do have at least one node in our list, we will end up assigning our
      <code>following</code> variable to whatever comes next, but we first need
      to be sure we have at least one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_mI2H8ml4185vxUDv5jDlw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Which brings us to our next point, how long do we keep running our
      reassignment algorithm? Or put another way, how do we know when to end
      this series of reassignments?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well if your goal is to look at EVERY node, and reassign its
      <code>next</code> property to whatever came before it, we need to make
      sure that our <code>current</code> variable is assigned once to every
      node. This means doing a linear scan through the list, starting at the
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually though, it will reach the last node’s <code>next</code>, which
      ALWAYS points to <code>null</code> . So we can can run this function
      <code>while (current !== null)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) { }}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*e-YtIM0myJ8u4pHbf-oK0Q.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      The third step is to figure out the order of operations so we don’t lose
      track of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      That while loop we just made won’t run unless we have at least one node.
      But once it does, the first thing we want to do is set
      <code>following</code> to <code>following.next</code> so we don’t lose
      track of what comes after <code>current</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, before this point <code>following</code> was equal to
      <code>current</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) {<br />
      following = following.next // &lt;===== 2a }}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*0Jans-aYx82quNdQzLHXVQ.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we want to do the reassignment of <code>current.next</code> , since
      we have all three pointers in place. This is the logic of actually
      reversing the linked list. We set <code>current.next</code> equal to
      <code>previous</code> , which at this point is equal to
      <code>null</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) {<br />
      following = following.next<br />
      current.next = previous // &lt;===== 2b }}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NZ4AlSDZo35AyIyaEwQWDQ.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we’ve done that, we can move <code>previous</code> up to equal
      <code>current</code> , since we’re done with that node.
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) {<br />
      following = following.next<br />
      current.next = previous<br />
      previous = current // &lt;===== 2c }}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Wzo9aRkPWI6YV4FFAEtv-Q.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then finally we can move <code>current</code> up by setting it equal
      to <code>following</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) {<br />
      following = following.next<br />
      current.next = previous<br />
      previous = current<br />
      current = following // &lt;===== 2d }}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3QHZ51QY_MfiDj3GB-FxDw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>So to summarize those steps:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Set <code>following</code> equal to <code>following.next</code></li>
      <li>Set <code>current.next</code> equal to <code>previous</code></li>
      <li>Set <code>previous</code> equal to <code>current</code></li>
      <li>Set <code>current</code> equal to <code>following</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And that completes one round of reversals. We just need to apply these
      same operations then to every node until we reach the end of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to think about what we’re doing, is that we’re looking at a small
      window around each node. We’re keeping track of the node before it so that
      we can point its <code>next</code> pointer to it. And we’re keeping track
      of the node after it so we don’t lose it and we can continue to move
      through the list.
    </p>
    <p>Which brings us to our final step, on what to return.</p>
    <p>
      Well following the diagram and code it should be pretty clear. Since the
      while loop is running as long as <code>current</code> is not
      <code>null</code> , then <code>current</code> must be
      <code>null</code> for us to break out of the loop.
      <code>following</code> also isn’t an option because at the end of a single
      loop, it’s equal to <code>current</code> .
    </p>
    <p>
      Which means we’re going to be returning <code>previous</code> , since it’s
      pointing to the node right before <code>current</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      function reverse(head) {// Step 1<br />
      let previous = null<br />
      let current = head<br />
      let following = head// Step 2<br />
      while(current !== null) {<br />
      following = following.next<br />
      current.next = previous<br />
      previous = current<br />
      current = following }// Step 3<br />
      return previous}
    </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Z8Of0kzeo3AuPaJ-l9c9gw.png"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      And that concludes the algorithm. As you can see it takes only 10 lines of
      code, and shouldn’t be something that trips you up on an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re looking for a challenge from here, try swapping two nodes in a
      linked list. Here’s a link to the problem description and a diagram as a
      hint:
