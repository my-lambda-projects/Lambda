      Basic Properties of a Linked List
    </h3>
    <p>
      A linked list is a simple, linear data structure used to store a
      collection of elements. Unlike an array, each element in a linked list
      does not have to be stored contiguously in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, in an array, each element of the list <code>[43, 32, 63</code
      > is stored in memory like so:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img

        alt="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/61d549f9-9f66-4d1f-9572-2d43098c2767_arrays-stored-in-memory.001.jpeg"
      />

        https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/61d549f9-9f66-4d1f-9572-2d43098c2767_arrays-stored-in-memory.001.jpeg
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <code>43</code> is the first item in the collection and is therefore
      stored in the first slot. <code>32</code> is the second item and is stored
      immediately next to <code>43</code> in memory. This pattern continues on
      and on.
    </p>
    <p>In a linked list, each element of the list could be stored like so:</p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/72151497-7a5e-4940-835c-d8beb9c88922_linked-list-in-memory.001.jpeg"
        alt="https://tk-assets.lambdaschool.com/72151497-7a5e-4940-835c-d8beb9c88922_linked-list-in-memory.001.jpeg"

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      You can see here that the elements can be spaced out in memory. Because
      the elements are not stored contiguously, each element in memory must
      contain information about the next element in the list. The first item
      stores the data <code>43</code> and the location in memory
      (<code>*3</code>) for the next item in the list. This example is
      simplified; the second item in the list <code>32</code> could be located
      anywhere in memory. It could even come before the first item in memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might also be wondering what types of data can be stored in a linked
      list. Pretty much any type of data can be stored in a linked list.
      Strings, numbers, booleans, and other data structures can be stored. You
      should not feel limited using a linked list based on what type of data you
      are trying to store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are the elements in a linked list are sorted or unsorted? The elements in
      a linked list can be either sorted or unsorted. There is nothing about the
      data structure that forces the elements to be sorted or unsorted. You
      cannot determine if a linked list’s elements are sorted by determining
      they are stored in a linked list.
    </p>
    <p>
      What about duplicates? Can a linked list contain them? Linked lists can
      contain duplicates. There is nothing about the linked list data structure
      that would prevent duplicates from being stored. When you encounter a
      linked list, you should know that it can contain duplicates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are there different types of linked lists? If so, what are they? There are
      three types of linked lists: singly linked list (SLL), doubly linked list
      (DLL), and circular linked list. All linked lists are made up of nodes
      where each node stores the data and also information about other nodes in
      the linked list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each singly linked list node stores the data and a pointer where the next
      node in the list is located. Because of this, you can only navigate in the
      forward direction in a singly linked list. To traverse an SLL, you need a
      reference to the first node called the head. From the head of the list,
      you can visit all the other nodes using the next pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between an SLL and a doubly linked list (DLL) is that each
      node in a DLL also stores a reference to the previous item. Because of
      this, you can navigate forward and backward in the list. A DLL also
      usually stores a pointer to the last item in the list (called the tail).
    </p>
    <p>
      A Circular Linked List links the last node back to the first node in the
      list. This linkage causes a circular traversal; when you get to the end of
      the list, the next item will be back at the beginning of the list. Each
      type of linked list is similar but has small distinctions. When working
      with linked lists, it’s essential to know what type of linked list.
    </p>
    <h3 id="time-and-space-complexity">Time and Space Complexity</h3>
    <h4 id="lookup">Lookup</h4>
    <p>
      To look up an item by index in a linked list is linear time
      (<code>O(n)</code>). To traverse through a linked list, you have to start
      with the head reference to the node and then follow each subsequent
      pointer to the next item in the chain. Because each item in the linked
      list is not stored contiguously in memory, you cannot access a specific
      index of the list using simple math. The distance in memory between one
      item and the next is varied and unknown.
    </p>
    <h4 id="append">Append</h4>
    <p>
      Adding an item to a linked list is constant time (<code>O(1)</code>). We
      always have a reference point to the tail of the linked list, so we can
      easily insert an item after the tail.
    </p>
    <h4 id="insert">Insert</h4>
    <p>
      In the worst case, inserting an item in a linked list is linear time
      (<code>O(n)</code>). To insert an item at a specific index, we have to
      traverse — starting at the head — until we reach the desired index.
    </p>
    <h4 id="delete">Delete</h4>
    <p>
      In the worst case, deleting an item in a linked list is linear time
      (<code>O(n)</code>). Just like insertion, deleting an item at a specific
      index means traversing the list starting at the head.
    </p>
    <h4 id="space">Space</h4>
    <p>
      The space complexity of a linked list is linear (<code>O(n)</code>). Each
      item in the linked list will take up space in memory.
    </p>
    <h3 id="strengths-of-a-linked-list">Strengths of a Linked List</h3>
    <p>
      The primary strength of a linked list is that operations on the linked
      list’s ends are fast. This is because the linked list always has a
      reference to the head (the first node) and the tail (the last node) of the
      list. Because it has a reference, doing anything on the ends is a constant
      time operation (<code>O(1)</code>) no matter how many items are stored in
      the linked list. Additionally, just like a dynamic array, you don’t have
      to set a capacity to a linked list when you instantiate it. If you don’t
      know the size of the data you are storing, or if the amount of data is
      likely to fluctuate, linked lists can work well. One benefit over a
      dynamic array is that you don’t have doubling appends. This is because
      each item doesn’t have to be stored contiguously; whenever you add an
      item, you need to find an open spot in memory to hold the next node.
    </p>
    <h3 id="weaknesses-of-a-linked-list">Weaknesses of a Linked List</h3>
    <p>
      The main weakness of a linked list is not efficiently accessing an “index”
      in the middle of the list. The only way that the linked list can get to
      the seventh item in the linked list is by going to the head node and then
      traversing one node at a time until you arrive at the seventh node. You
      can’t do simple math and jump from the first item to the seventh.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-data-structures-are-built-on-linked-lists">
      What data structures are built on linked lists?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Remember that linked lists have efficient operations on the ends (head and
      tail). There are two structures that only operate on the ends; queues and
      stacks. So, most queue or stack implementations use a linked list as their
      underlying data structure.
    </p>
    <h3
      id="why-is-a-linked-list-different-than-an-array-what-problem-does-it-solve"
    >
      Why is a linked list different than an array? What problem does it solve?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We can see the difference between how a linked list and an array are
      stored in memory, but why is this important? Once you see the problem with
      the way arrays are stored in memory, the benefits of a linked list become
      clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary problem with arrays is that they hold data contiguously in
      memory. Remember that having the data stored contiguously is the feature
      that gives them quick lookups. If I know where the first item is stored, I
      can use simple math to figure out where the fifth item is stored. The
      reason that this is a problem is that it means that when you create an
      array, you either have to know how much space in memory you need to set
      aside, or you have to set aside a bunch of extra memory that you might not
      need, just in case you do need it. In other words, you can be
      space-efficient by only setting aside the memory you need at the moment.
      But, in doing that, you are setting yourself up for low time efficiency if
      you run out of room and need to copy all of your elements to a newer,
      bigger array.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a linked list, the elements are not stored side-by-side in memory.
      Each element can be stored anywhere in memory. In addition to storing the
      data for that element, each element also stores a pointer to the memory
      location of the next element in the list. The elements in a linked list do
      not have an index. To get to a specific element in a linked list, you have
      to start at the head of the linked list and work your way through the
      list, one element at a time, to reach the specific element you are
      searching for. Now you can see how a linked list solves some of the
      problems that the array data structure has.

      How do you represent a linked list graphically and in Python code?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let’s look at how we can represent a singly linked list graphically and in
      Python code. Seeing a singly linked list represented graphically and in
      code can help you understand it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do you represent a singly linked list graphically? Let’s say you
      wanted to store the numbers 1, 2, and 3. You would need to create three
      nodes. Then, each of these nodes would be linked together using the
      pointers.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Notice that the last element or node in the linked list does not have a
      pointer to any other node. This fact is how you know you are at the end of
      the linked list.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does a singly linked list implementation look like in Python? Let’s
      start by writing a <code>LinkedListNode</code> class for each element in
      the linked list.
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode py"
      ><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">class</span> LinkedListNode:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="fu">__init__</span>(<span class="va">self</span>, data<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">None</span>, <span class="bu">next</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="va">None</span>):</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">        <span class="va">self</span>.data <span class="op">=</span> data</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">        <span class="va">self</span>.<span class="bu">next</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">next</span></a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now, we need to build out the class for
      the <code>LinkedList</code> itself:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode py"
      ><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="kw">class</span> LinkedList:</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2">    <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="fu">__init__</span>(<span class="va">self</span>, head<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">None</span>):</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3">        <span class="va">self</span>.head <span class="op">=</span> head</a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      Our class is super simple so far and only includes an initialization
      method. Let’s add an <code>append</code> method so that we can add nodes
      to the end of our list:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode py"

      Now, let’s use our simple class definitions
      for <code>LinkedListNode</code> and <code>LinkedList</code> to create a
      linked list of elements <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
      and <code>3</code>.

      You must be able to understand and interact with linked lists. You now
      know the basic properties and types of linked lists, what makes a linked
      list different from an array, what problem it solves, and how to represent
      them both graphically and in code. You now know enough about linked lists
      that you should be able to solve algorithmic code challenges that require
      a basic understanding of linked lists.
