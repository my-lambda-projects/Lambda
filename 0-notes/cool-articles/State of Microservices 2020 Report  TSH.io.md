### Marek Gajda

CTO of The Software House

— Microservice architecture is not a cure for all of your software problems. If you think that you can run a short-term, microservices-based business project without previous experience, you’re probably wrong.

### Peter Cooper

Founder of Cooperpress

— Much like the almost universal growth of CI (after initially being more popular within larger companies and teams), I’d expect to see significant growth for monorepo use over the next couple of years.

### Luca Mezzalira

VP of Architecture at DAZN

— When it comes to micro frontends, the main problem is that this technology is just starting to get traction and people aren’t really familiar with it – which gives rise to lots of misconceptions.

### Richard Rodger

Author of “The Tao of Microservices”

— I believe microservices are the future, however, at the same time, we will see the term “microservices” virtually evaporate.

## State of Microservices 2020

Part 01: **Developers**

### 669 microservice experts from around the world

Microservice architecture – an architectural style where your application is based on a collection of fine-grained, interconnected services – is definitely a hot thing right now. But what are the pros and cons of this architecture? What’s the future of this trend? Should we all jump on the microservices hype train? Well, to find out, we decided to create this report.

The goal of the State of Microservices 2020 research project was as straightforward as it was ambitious. We wanted to find out how developers around the globe really build their microservices. And if you’re wondering if we succeeded – just take a look at the map below.

Where do the respondents come from?

Total answers 669

Firstly, over 650 software developers decided to take part in our survey. Secondly, more than a half of these talented folks were CTOs, Lead Developers or Senior Developers, showing us all how experienced the microservice community is. And, last but not least, the respondents really came from all around the world, making the report even more useful and universal than we had wished in the beginning.

However, numbers are just numbers. And this is why we decided to let the voice of the microservice gurus be heard by inviting the awesome people of DAZN, Cooperpress, Vercel and more to comment on the results. You’ll find their expert opinions on the following pages.

Part 02: **Maturity**

### Great architecture for solving scalability issues

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/marek-gajda-small.png)

I must admit that when we were designing the State of Microservices 2020 survey I had some presumptions. And, when the results arrived, most of my assumptions were confirmed – however, both the positive and the negative ones.

In my opinion, the two most important topics when it comes to microservices are: improving scalability and improving performance. All in all, that’s why the idea of microservice architecture was dreamt up in the first place, wasn’t it? Fortunately, it seems that software developers around the world are truly happy about building microservices when it comes to solving scalability issues (average rating: 4.3 out of 5) and performance issues (average rating: 3.9). It’s even more evident when you look at the responses of CTOs – who should hold the most informed view when it comes to such issues – and who rated the scalability potential to 4.4 and the performance potential to 4.3.

> **The two most important topics when it comes to microservices are scalability and performance.**

On the other hand, it seems that maintenance and debugging of microservices are a bit of a problem for many developers. Speaking from my professional experience at The Software House, I must confirm that these findings are true. For the last 2 or 3 years, more and more clients have approached us and asked us for help because their in-house development teams lost control over microservice-based projects. Usually, after some hussle, everything can be straightened out but my protip for you is: hire an experienced DevOps engineer at the very beginning of your microservice project. These guys can do real magic when it comes to future-oriented thinking and planning out your whole system’s architecture.

All in all, microservice architecture is not a cure for all of your software problems. If you think that you can run a short-term, microservices-based business project without previous experience, you’re probably wrong. However, if your business is based on scalability and you take a minute to plan out the software architecture in the very beginning of a project – to make sure that every service is organized around business capabilities – you’ll definitely see the benefits of microservices.

Part 03: **Programming languages**

### JavaScript and TypeScript rule all

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/adam-polak-small.png)

To be honest, when I first saw the results of this part of the survey, I was pretty surprised. I knew that JavaScript and TypeScript were getting more and more popular – but was it really possible that those were the main programming languages for almost ⅔ of microservice developers? Well, it certainly seems so!

For a pretty long time, microservice architecture has been associated with huge, enterprise solutions. And those were usually built using Java or .Net. However, it seems that things are changing pretty rapidly. Firstly, more and more people are talking about Universal JavaScript and how this language (both with TypeScript) is gaining popularity. Secondly, developers start building microservices not only for enterprise-grade platforms but also for medium-size software projects. Thirdly, the “microservices plus serverless” model is also on the rise and we all know that JavaScript and TypeScript go pretty well with serverless.

> **Microservices and JavaScript/TypeScript go very well together.**

The results of our State of Microservices 2020 survey confirm all of these trends. 437 people (65%) named JavaScript/TypeScript one of their architecture’s main technologies. And 171 of them (26%) chose JS/TS as the ONLY programming language for their microservices.

Whether you like this trend or not, one must say that microservices and JavaScript/TypeScript go very well together. Before the era of workers, Node.js architecture was very prone to slowdowns, so Node.js developers simply had to learn how to work with multiple, small, individual services.

Now, it’s a part of their developer DNA – and it makes building and maintaining microservice architecture whole lotta easier.

What are your architecture’s main technologies?

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- .Net
- Python
- PHP
- Go
- Ruby
- Other

Part 04: **Deployment and serverless**

### Microservice developers choose AWS

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/yan-cui-small.png)

When I look at the results of the survey, I see that the market of cloud providers and serverless is thriving – there are as many obvious findings as there are surprises.

Quite unsurprisingly, AWS is the most popular (49%) deployment target, and most people are using Kubernetes (65%) for service discovery. What is surprising, however, is that 34% of respondents are running on-prem, which is as much as Azure (17%) and GCP (17%) combined! I guess that when you’re in the cloud bubble, it’s easy to forget that traditional DCs is still a $200B business (annually) and accounts for as much IT spending as all the cloud providers combined.

I’m pleased to see that nearly half of the respondents said they’re already using serverless technologies. Here, once again, AWS Lambda is the clear leader with 62% of the responses. I did, however, expect to see Azure functions (13%) faring better than Google Cloud Functions (14%) – given that GCP is still focused on their container services and has largely neglected Google Cloud Functions. Perhaps the numbers have been helped by Firebase, which has a strong user base and does have a good developer story with Firebase functions.

> **I’m pleased to see that nearly half of the microservices developers are already using serverless technologies.**

All in all, while we can definitely see that Amazon Web Services are leading when it comes to cloud and serverless, the situation is still far from a monopoly. With other providers reaching for their piece of cake, and with bare-metal servers grabbing a huge market share, one thing is certain – when you’re a microservice developer, there’s plenty of options for you to choose from.

Where do you usually deploy your microservices to?

- Amazon Web Services
- My own server
- Azure
- Google Cloud Platform
- Other

Do you use serverless technology?

Which serverless solution is your preferred one?

- AWS Lambda
- Google Functions
- Azure Functions
- ZEIT Now

Do you use AWS Serverless Application Model?

Part 05: **Repositories**

### Monorepo or multirepo?

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/peter-cooper-small.png)

It’s not a big surprise that the majority of respondents say that they prefer using multiple repositories for their projects – that’s been the status quo for years now. It’s more interesting, however, that as many as 32.9% said they DO prefer monorepos. And this number is sure to grow.

> **I expect to see significant growth for monorepo use over the next couple of years.**

The monorepo approach to software development involves storing the files for numerous projects within a single repository (that’s internally segregated in some way, usually through folder structure). One company well known for adopting this approach is Google. With the majority of their code residing within a single monolithic repository, they can take advantage of easier code reuse across the company and easier integration with their company-wide CI systems. Other companies using monorepos, at least to some extent, are Microsoft, Facebook, Digital Ocean, Twitter, and Uber. On the other hand, the monorepo approach is still broadly considered cutting-edge or experimental in smaller companies and in single developer cases. To be honest, it’s not that surprising, as the approach’s main advantages are around teamwork and integration.

However, much like the almost universal growth of CI (after initially being more popular within larger companies and teams), I’d expect to see significant growth for monorepo use outside of its core user base over the next couple of years too. Especially, as more tools (many of them open source) emerge that target smaller use cases.

How do you like your code stored?

- Multiple repositories
- Monorepo
- Other

Part 06: **Varia**

### Communication, authorisation, message brokers

How do your microservices communicate with each other?

- Http
- Events
- gRPC
- WebSockets
- Other

- Only the gateway API authorises the request
- Each system authorises the request
- Other

Do you use message brokers?

Part 07: **Continuous integration**

### Microservices + CI = <3

It’s fantastic to see that almost 87% respondents use Continuous Integration. It’s fair to say that CI is quickly becoming a standard – at least among the developers who build microservices. However, I can’t stop wondering: what is the rest doing? 13% is a pretty significant number! So, the need to educate and help developers to understand the topic is still there.

What makes me genuinely happy, are the results regarding the most popular CI solutions. Frankly, I did expect Jenkins to have a bit bigger share, but the fact is that the industry is changing and it is great to see that there is a diversity in the area. Especially, as many of these CI solutions are available “out-of-the box”, provided to you alongside a repository or a cloud solution. In practice, it means that running pipelines is now easier than ever before – and, judging by the numbers, it is working really well.

> **It’s fair to say that CI is quickly becoming a standard – at least among the microservice developers.**

Having so many options to choose from might also impact the way the CI pipelines are built. Nowadays, it makes a lot of sense to put an effort into writing a pipeline in a smart way, so it is easy to migrate to another solution if need be. Of course, that requires a bit more attention at the beginning of the process, but it gives you bigger freedom and might be very rewarding in the future.

CI/CD is an important aspect of the software development process and it can bring many benefits to those who use it. Having a variety of well-working solutions (very often open source ones) and good practices to choose from is a luxurious situation for all of us.

Do you use Continuous Integration?

Which CI solution do you prefer?

- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- Circle CI
- Bitbucket Pipelines
- Travis CI
- Azure DevOps/Pipelines
- Other

Part 08: **Debugging**

### Are logs enough for your project?

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/thomas-boltze-small.png)

For me, as the Chief Technology Officer, the survey results regarding debugging solutions were particularly interesting. The thing that immediately captured my attention was that the most popular debugging solution, with as much as 86% of microservices developers choosing this answer, were… logs.

It shouldn’t be that alarming, as it was a multiple-choice question. However, when getting deeper, we can see that as much as 179 respondents (27%) use ONLY logs. Knowing that logs definitely don’t show you everything, it poses quite a problem. In yet another question – where we asked people how would they rate building microservices when it comes to various areas of software development (see: Chapter 2. Maturity) – maintenance and debugging were voted the most problematic areas. These two pieces of information correspond very well.

> **Development teams struggle with predicting the consequences of going all-in with microservices.**

Sadly, it’s also consistent with my personal observations. In general, I find that development teams often struggle with two things: predicting the consequences of going all-in with the microservices, and getting the scope of a service right. Firstly, people start building services, but forget about fault tolerance, permissions, monitoring, etc. Secondly, they often tend to go overboard, making the individual services super small before they have anything in place to manage that effectively – and then wonder why failure modes are taking over, try to do distributed transactions, and generally end up in some form of misery.

Microservice architecture is a great invention and I must say we benefit from it a lot at Asto Digital. However, before developing microservices-based software, you must think about the future and prepare for maintenance beforehand. It’s tricky business. Starting to care about debugging in the middle of the development process – when things finally “go south” – is simply too late.

What are your favourite debugging solutions?

- Logs
- Tracing
- Metrics
- Health checks
- Other

Part 09: **Consumption of APIs**

### Is static the future?

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sarup-banskota-small.png)

Sarup Banskota

Head of Growth at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

The findings in the State of Microservices report regarding the consumption of APIs are consistent with the industry trends we’ve been noticing here at Vercel (formerly ZEIT). Consumers today are more impatient than ever, demanding top-notch performance from the applications they use.

Personally, I’m particularly interested in JAMstack-powered (static) sites, which 57.5% of the survey respondents are developing. Static sites are a great choice for modern web applications. They can be aggressively cached, and served with minimal latency via Edge networks. Thanks to the proliferation of API-based solutions spanning every aspect of development, businesses can focus on building core features, testing variations, and ultimately serving their customers better.

> **Consumers today are more impatient than ever, demanding top-notch performance from the applications they use.**

Going static allows rapid iteration, top-notch client performance, vastly reduced development and hosting costs, zero-downtime, faster builds – there is little room to complain! With a technology stack like Next.js and Vercel, developers are able to elevate their Git-based workflow to a Deploy–Preview–Ship workflow, unlocking all the benefits of working with static in one neat package.

Thanks to integrations with GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and Slack – the adoption is only increasing among remote teams. We’re incredibly excited for the future.

How are you consuming the responses of your microservices?

- Service to service
- Static frontend
- Mobile apps
- SSR frontend
- Other

Part 10: **Micro frontends**

### Time for the microservice revolution on frontend?

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/luca-mezzalira-small.png)

I don’t expect the percentage of developers using micro frontends to grow far more than the 24% that we see in the results of the survey. However, it doesn’t mean that there’s no place for the microservice revolution on frontend. Quite the contrary.

The main problem when it comes to micro frontends is that this technology is just starting to get traction and people aren’t really familiar with it – which gives rise to lots of misconceptions. For example, people believe that assembling multiple micro frontends in the same view, using a few different frameworks, may lead to an app that weighs 10 MB instead of 100 KB. Well, yeah, you can do it – just as you could do, technically speaking, with single page applications – but obviously it won’t work well.

> **This paradigm allows you to scale up by breaking interface into separate features developed by separate teams.**

That’s why, some time ago, I’ve decided to debunk these myths and spread the knowledge regarding micro frontends. The fact is that applications tend to get more complicated on frontend, so you can’t always use the same pattern. So far, we’ve usually built either a single page application (SPA) or one based on server-side rendering. Now, there’s the need for a third option – a paradigm that allows you to scale up by breaking your interface into separate features developed by separate teams. That’s the micro frontend pattern.

I discourage people from using micro frontends in new projects without understanding the business and organizational challenges which are there to solve. That’s because when deciding to use micro frontends, you need to invest resources in creating the automation pipeline, in designing proper communication, in taking care of governance, etc. However, if you believe that the frontends of your applications need to be ready for scaling up, micro frontends are definitely something you should get to know better.

Have you used micro frontends?

How do you compose your micro frontends?

- Web components
- Server-side rendering
- Micro frontends as npm packages
- iFrame
- Other

Part 11: **Future**

### Microservices – the new backend architecture standard

![](https://tsh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/richard-rodger-small.png)

The great benefit of the microservices architecture, and the reason that it will dominate the future of software development, is that it provides a practical component architecture. In my own work building such systems, two core principles keep coming up, and their effectiveness in practice remains the reason why I believe microservices are the future: the basic principle of independent components exchanging messages, and the dynamic routing of those messages.

> **We will see the term “microservices” virtually evaporate.**

The first, transport independence, means simply that how messages are transferred, is quite irrelevant. I mean this up to the level of the messaging model – synchronous or asynchronous, it really doesn’t matter. What does matter, is that messages are the only interface. This reduces the component integration surface drastically, and enables composition – the most important attribute of a component model.

And the second principle is zero identity. Microservices and components must not know about each other. Messages are simply sent and received with no thought for destination. This approach provides the dynamic ongoing modification of live systems. Sadly, many implementations that I see in the wild still rely on concepts of identity embedded within services – this is the single greatest mistake that leads to most of the microservice horror stories.

However, with these two principles – which will become almost invisible features of the microservice substrate – we will see the term “microservices” virtually evaporate, and that means they will truly have become the primary architecture of software development.

What do you think about the future of microservice architecture?

- It will be a standard but only for more complex systems
- It will become the industry standard for backend development
- It will be completely dethroned by some new architectural solution
- It will end up as a curiosity used only by a group of fanatic developers
- Other
