# 6.4 Ants on a Triangle

# There are 3 ants on different vertices of a triangle.
# What is the probability of collision, between any 2 or all of them, if they start walking on the sides of the triangle?
# Assume that each ant: 
    # randomly picks a direction with either direction likely to be chosen AND
    # that they walk at the same speed.

# Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.
