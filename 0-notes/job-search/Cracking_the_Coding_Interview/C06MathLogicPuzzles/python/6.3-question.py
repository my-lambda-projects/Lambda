# 6.3 Dominos

# There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
# You are given 31 dominos and a single domino can cover exactly 2 squares.
# Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
# Prove your answer by providing an example or showing why it's impossible.

# Impossible because one will always end up sticking out due to the corners being cut off.
