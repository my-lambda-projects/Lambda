# 1. match_ends
# Given a list of strings, return the count of the number of
# strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first
# and last chars of the string are the same.
# Note: python does not have a ++ operator, but += works.
def match_ends(words):
  # Your code here
  count = 0
  for word in words:
    if len(word) >= 2 and word[0] == word[-1]:
      count = count + 1
  return count


# 2. front_x
# Given a list of strings, return a list with the strings
# in sorted order, except group all the strings that begin with 'x' first.
# e.g. ['mix', 'xyz', 'apple', 'xanadu', 'aardvark'] yields
# ['xanadu', 'xyz', 'aardvark', 'apple', 'mix']
# Hint: this can be done by making 2 lists and sorting each of them
# before combining them.
def front_x(words):
  # Your code here
  x_list = []
  other_list = []
  for w in words:
    if w.startswith('x'):
      x_list.append(w)
    else:
      other_list.append(w)
  return sorted(x_list) + sorted(other_list)


# 3. sort_last
# Given a list of non-empty tuples, return a list sorted in increasing
# order by the last element in each tuple.
# e.g. [(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)] yields
# [(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 7)]
# Hint: use a custom key= function to extract the last element form each tuple.
def sort_last(tuples):
  # Your code here
  return sorted(tuples, key=lambda a: a[-1])
