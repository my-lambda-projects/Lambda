# Problem 9
# Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (including 1 and 100). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
# Hint:
# Remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise.
# Extras:
# Keep the game going until the user types "exit".
# Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
