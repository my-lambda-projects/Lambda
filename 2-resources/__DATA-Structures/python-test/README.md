# Python Practice Assessment

Congratulations on learning the basics of Python! Now, here's a practice assessment for you to help you study for next week's assessment.

In this practice assessment, you will write Python code to make a series of unit tests pass.

## Usage

1. `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
2. **Run the tests by typing `python -m unittest`**.
3. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following Python modules so that when you run `python -m unittest`, all tests pass.
   - **problem_01_while_loop.py** will have you make tests pass with a `while` loop
   - **problem_02_for_loop.py** will have you make tests pass with a `for` loop
   - **problem_03_list_comprehension.py** will have you make tests pass with a list comprehension
   - **problem_04_if_statement.py** will have you make tests pass with an `if` statement
   - **problem_05_class.py** will have you write a class to make tests pass
   - **problem_06_inhertiance.py** will have you write classes that inherit from one another to make tests pass
   - **problem_07_dictionary.py** will have you use a dictionary to make tests pass
   - **problem_08_builtins.py** will have you use one of the built-in functions covered in homework to make tests pass
   - **problem_09_getters_and_setters.py** will have you use getter and setter properties to make tests pass
   - **problem_10_functions.py** will have you use lexical closures and functions that return functions to make tests pass.
