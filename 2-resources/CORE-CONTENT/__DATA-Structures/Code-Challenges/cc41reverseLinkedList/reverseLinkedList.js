/* cc41 reverseLinkedList https://repl.it/student/submissions/1489170
Write a function that will take the head of a singly-linked list,
and reverse it, such that the head is now the tail, and the node
that head pointed to now points to the old head (the new tail).
*/

function reverseList( node ) {
  // Not quite sure how to proceed without an example data structure
  // Are all singly-linked lists the same? From the test:
  // Expected null to be
  // Node({ value: 'C', next: Node({ value: 'D', next: null }) })
  // swap head and tail
  // [ node.head, node.tail ] = [ node.tail, node.head ];
  // then reverse pointers ... ???
  // walk through the list one item at a time and put it in an array
  // e.g. [head, ..., tail]
  // then pop off the array iems into the Linked List function...
  // but I don't have a single linked list making function here...???
